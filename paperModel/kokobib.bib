  abstract = {In spite of the economic importance and extensive agronomic literature on cocoa, no physiological production model has been developed for cocoa so far. Such a model would be very useful to compare yields in different climates and cropping systems, and to set the agenda for future agronomic research. Here, we present and apply such a physiological growth and production model for cocoa (SUCROS-Cocoa), based on the SUCROS-family of physiological crop growth models. Our model calculates light interception, photosynthesis, maintenance respiration, evapotranspiration, biomass production and bean yield for cocoa trees grown under shade trees. It can cope with both potential and water-limited situations, and is parameterised using existing information on cocoa physiology and morphology. A validation study showed that the model produces realistic output for bean yield, standing biomass, leaf area and size–age relations. Simulations were carried out using climatic information of 30 locations in 10 cocoa-producing countries, three different soil types and varying shade levels. The model was applied to answer four questions that are currently relevant to cocoa production. (1) Which are the most important yield-determining parameters? Sensitivity analyses revealed that these parameters were chiefly related to the morphology of fruits, photosynthesis and maintenance respiration. (2) To what extent can cocoa yield be predicted by rainfall and irradiance data? Regression analyses showed that over 70% of the variation in simulated bean yield could be explained by a combination of annual radiation and rainfall during the two driest months. (3) How large is the cocoa yield gap due to water limitation? Yield gaps were large – up to 50% – for locations with a strong dry season combined with an unfavourable (clayey or sandy) soil. The calculated yield gaps decreased exponentially with the amount of rain during the two driest months. (4) What are the consequences of shading on cocoa yield? Our simulations showed that moderate shade levels hardly affected bean yield, whereas heavy shading (>60%) reduced yields by more than one-third.},

  abstract = {Crop models are important tools for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production. While multiple models have been developed over the past decades for the major food and fiber crops such as wheat, maize, soybean, rice, and cotton, there are few or none for many other crops. The goal of this study was to develop a simple generic crop model (SIMPLE) that could be easily modified for any crop to simulate development, crop growth and yield. The crop model SIMPLE includes 13 parameters to specify a crop type, with four of these for cultivar characteristics. Commonly available inputs that are required for the crop model SIMPLE include daily weather data, crop management, and soil water holding parameters. The initial SIMPLE model was calibrated and evaluated for 14 different annual crops using observations for biomass growth, solar radiation interception, and yield from 25 detailed field experiments for a total of 70 treatments from 17 sites, resulting in a RRMSE of 25.4% for final yield. A sensitivity analysis comparing a C3, C4 and a legume crop showed an expected response to a gradual increase in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A regional gridded simulation for US potatoes reproduced the general observed patterns of spatial yield variability. Because the model is simple, it has several limitations, including the lack of response to vernalization and photoperiod effect on phenology. The model includes water, but no nutrient dynamics. However, an advantage of the model simplicity is that it can be easily adapted and evaluated for any new crop, based on literature data and field experiments, or general crop data such as sowing and harvest dates and yield statistics. The model is available in several simulation frameworks including a stand-alone version in R, Excel and as part of DSSAT.},

These challenges are identified through a multidimensional and region-specific gap analysis that integrates the advances and technological trends developed worldwide as ideal practice scenarios.

In this work, during cocoa fermentation, flavor formation was studied at different fermentation times based on sensory profiles, volatile compound contents and untargeted metabolomics. It was observed that chocolate quality is influenced by fermentation time. Thus, at 72 h, the sensory profiles showed no outstanding attributes, while at 96 h, the global quality presented a stronger influence of fine attributes, such as fruitiness, florality, spices and nuttiness. Finally, at 120/144 h, these FFC features diminished. Metabolomic fingerprint of cocoa beans (related to peptides, sugars, amino acids, and phenolic compounds) and the volatile fingerprint of chocolate showed a change according to the fermentation time. This allowed the proposal of 96 h as the optimal fermentation time to produce FFC beans. Additionally, 20 volatiles and 48 discriminating metabolites were defined as potential quality biomarkers.},

It was carried out a study in the Macarena-Guaviare region, Colombia to evaluate the level of knowledge of cocoa producers, to analyze how this knowledge is affected by familiar, organizational or productive variables, and to determine the formation needs. To determine the level of knowledge, it was proposed a methodology called “Cacota test” which was applied and validated by cocoa producers (n = 189). It was evaluated the knowledge about the links (a. Crop design, b. Clones, c. Soil fertility, d. Pruning, e. Pests and diseases management, f. Good agricultural practices, g. Harvest, h. Post-harvest, i. Transformation, j. Marketing, k. Associativity, l. Institutionality). By means of a cluster analysis, producers were typified according to their level of knowledge and it was made a principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the relation between the links and types of producers. It was elaborated a Cocoa Knowledge Index (CKI) and the links with greater and lesser strength regarding management level were identified. Also, the variables which influence the CKI were identified using a linear regression model. Positive correlations were found between the links: a. Clones and Soil fertility, b. Pruning and good agricultural practices, c. Pruning and pests and diseases management. The typologies were affected by the level of education, level of associativity and cultivated area. The local knowledge was not significantly related to age and gender. The proposed methodology made possible to determine the level of local knowledge of cocoa crop management practices. The institutions or people responsible for the formation of cocoa producers in the Macarena-Guaviare region should focus on crop design, clones, soil fertility, harvest, post-harvest and transformation links.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models have been widely employed for the simulation of growth dynamics of annual crops, thereby performing yield prediction, but not for fruit tree species such as jujube tree (Zizyphus jujuba). The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential use of a modified WOFOST model for predicting jujube yield by introducing tree age as a key parameter. The model was established using data collected from dedicated field experiments performed in 2016–2018. Simulated growth dynamics of dry weights of leaves, stems, fruits, total biomass and leaf area index (LAI) agreed well with measured values, showing root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.143, 0.333, 0.366, 0.624 t ha−1 and 0.19, and R2 values of 0.947, 0.976, 0.985, 0.986 and 0.95, respectively. Simulated phenological development stages for emergence, anthesis and maturity were 2, 3 and 3 days earlier than the observed values, respectively. In addition, in order to predict the yields of trees with different ages, the weight of new organs (initial buds and roots) in each growing season was introduced as the initial total dry weight (TDWI), which was calculated as averaged, fitted and optimized values of trees with the same age. The results showed the evolution of the simulated LAI and yields profiled in response to the changes in TDWI. The modelling performance was significantly improved when it considered TDWI integrated with tree age, showing good global (R2≥0.856, RMSE≤0.68 t ha−1) and local accuracies (mean R2≥0.43, RMSE≤0.70 t ha−1). Furthermore, the optimized TDWI exhibited the highest precision, with globally validated R2 of 0.891 and RMSE of 0.591 t ha−1, and local mean R2 of 0.57 and RMSE of 0.66 t ha−1, respectively. The proposed model was not only verified with the confidence to accurately predict yields of jujube, but it can also provide a fundamental strategy for simulating the growth of other fruit trees.},

  abstract = {Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), a major commodity globally, depends on insects for pollination. However, the cocoa pollinator identity is largely unknown and there are important knowledge gaps regarding landscape and farm-level management driving pollinators. Here we analyzed flower visitation with two approaches to quantify how landscape and farm-level factors affect potential pollinators (flower visitors) of cocoa in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In the first approach (landscape and farm-level) we selected 18 farms and focused on the relative importance of distance to forest (m), potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm (i.e. secondary forests and cocoa agroforests [%]), canopy cover (%), leaf-litter amount (kg/m2), and cocoa flower abundance for flower visitors. In the second approach (experimental farm management) we manipulated leaf-litter in 24 farms, because high leaf-litter is suggested to enhance flower visitors. We found that ants and Diptera were the most common flower visitors, and although previous studies suggest ceratopogonids as main cocoa pollinators, none were captured in this study. In the landscape and farm-level approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm, and increased canopy cover enhanced ant and Diptera abundance, whereas distance to forest had no effect. In the experimental farm management approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm rather than leaf-litter manipulation increased Diptera and ant abundance. In summary conservation of forests and agroforests surrounding the farm, maintaining canopy cover and minimum leaf-litter enhance cocoa flower visitors. Thus, farms with shade trees embedded in a biodiversity-friendly landscape are important for conservation of potential pollinators and pollination services and, thereby, promotion of sustainable cocoa.},

  abstract = {Abstract The biosynthesis of lipid in maturing cacao seeds was studied over two cropping seasons (1975\s-1976) in Brazil using hybrids produced by cross pollination of Catongo with Amelonado cultivars. Seeds were collected at intervals between seed solidification (110\s-120 days postpollination) and harvesting of ripe fruits at 175\s-180 days. Lipid accumulated in seeds at a rapid, linear rate after the seeds solidified until near the beginning of ripening, when lipid build up proceeded at a greatly reduced rate. Triglyceride was the major lipid component at all stages of maturity, increasing from 69\% to 96\% of the total lipid over the period studied. The contributions of other lipid components to total lipids became less prominent as fat accumulated in seeds. However, on an individual seed basis their mass increased throughout development, except for phospholipids and diglycerides, which decreased on a mass/seed basis in the latter stages of fruit maturation. Since the rate of triglyceride production slowed at about the same time, the reduced amounts of phospholipids and diglycerides indicate the classical Kennedy pathway for triglyceride synthesis is operative in seeds of cacao. Fat present early in seed development was more unsaturated than typical cocoa butter of commerce. However, as lipid deposited during the period of active lipid synthesis, starting at about 130 days postpollination, a normal fatty acid composition was quickly established and did not change materially thereafter.},

This chapter provides insight into the value of using temperature for predicting plant development and discusses some of the sources of uncertainties when using a temperature summation system. Most available daily maximum and minimum temperature records have been observed from liquid-in-glass thermometers exposed in standard white, louvered instrument shelters. The prediction of development using thermal time has usually focused around the timing of important events in the phasic development of determinant crops, such as time to anthesis and physiological maturity. Germination has been used often for evaluating developmental temperature response functions. The chapter addresses the influence of photoperiod on the prediction of crop development and temperature relationships. As with photoperiod, vernalization has an influence on leaf numbers.},

  abstract = {A simple, mechanistic model describing the growth and yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was extended to water-limited conditions. The activities of three physiological processes were potentially retarded upon soil dehydration: leaf growth, crop gas exchange, and rate of ontogenetic development. Each of these processes was related directly to soil water content, which was calculated daily based on estimates of transpiration, soil evaporation, and water additions. For eight of the nine years experimentally studied at Gilat, Israel, the agreement between simulated and observed grain-yields differed no more than 26 g m−2. In the ninth year (1979/80), a severe drought during seed maturation decreased yields and caused the simulation to overestimate the yield. Nevertheless, the simple, mechanistic model demonstrated the importance of water availability in accounting for seasonal variations in yield. Both the amount and pattern of seasonal rainfall were found to be important in determining yield. Drought stress at anthesis was found in the simulations to have a particularly large negative effect on grain-yield, because anthesis coincides with the period in crop development requiring the maximum amounts of water.},

  abstract = {An existing simulation model of wheat growth and development, Sirius, was evaluated through a systematic model reduction procedure. The model was automatically manipulated under software control to replace variables within the model structure with constants, individually and in combination. Predictions of the resultant models were compared to growth analysis observations of total biomass, grain yield, and canopy leaf area derived from 9 trials conducted in the UK and New Zealand under optimal, nitrogen limiting and drought conditions. Model performance in predicting these observations was compared in order to evaluate whether individual model variables contributed positively to the overall prediction. Of the 111 model variables considered 16 were identified as potentially redundant. Areas of the model where there was evidence of redundancy were: (a) translocation of biomass carbon to grain; (b) nitrogen physiology; (c) adjustment of air temperature for various modelled processes; (d) allowance for diurnal variation in temperature; (e) vernalisation (f) soil nitrogen mineralisation (g) soil surface evaporation. It is not suggested that these are not important processes in real crops, rather, that their representation in the model cannot be justified in the context of the analysis. The approach described is analogous to a detailed model inter-comparison although it would be better described as a model intra-comparison as it is based on the comparison of many simplified forms of the same model. The approach provides automation to increase the efficiency of the evaluation and a systematic means of increasing the rigour of the evaluation.},

The quantification of these documented effects by means of a suitable crop model, BAMGRO is presented in this paper. Data on canopy development from five growth chamber, four glasshouse and three field experiments were analyzed to calibrate and validate the BAMGRO model to produce simulations for temperature stress, drought stress and photoperiodic effect on two contrasting landraces; Uniswa Red (Swaziland) and S19-3 (Namibia). The daily initiation rate of new leaves is calculated by means of a Gaussian function and is altered by temperature stress, drought stress, photoperiod and plant density. The rate in dead leaf number is dependent upon the maximum senescence fraction which can be explained by physiological maturity, mutual shading, temperature stress and drought stress. The leaf area expansion is calculated as a function of leaf number and individual leaf size. The canopy development of bambara groundnut is modelled (and tested) in BAMGRO model by means of leaf initiation and leaf area expansion and branching and stem production are not considered. Nash and Sutcliffe value (N–S) is used as the measure of the mean square error to the observed variance. The simulated leaf number per plant correlated well with the glasshouse measurements for Uniswa Red for the two considered years (2007 and 2008) with high N–S value (Nash and Sutcliffe; from 0.76 to 0.92), low mean absolute error (MAE; from ±2.91 to 3.98) and Botswana field grown in January 18 and February 1, 2007 (N–S, 0.88 and 0.74; MAE, ±0.59 and ±6.18). Overall, simulated LAI correlated well with measured values for the two tested landraces; S19-3 (N–S value, 0.84) and Uniswa Red (N–S value, 0.80) with maximum MAE less than ±0.50 thus explaining canopy development under temperature stress, drought stress and variable photoperiods.},

In this study, we tested the SUBSTOR-potato model with 87 field experiments, including 204 treatments from 19 countries. The field experiments varied in potato species and cultivars, N fertilizer application, water supply, sowing dates, soil types, temperature environments, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and included open top chamber and Free-Air-CO2-Enrichment (FACE) experiments. Tuber yields were generally well simulated with the SUBSTOR-potato model across a wide range of current growing conditions and for diverse potato species and cultivars, including Solanum tuberosum, Solanum andigenum, Solanum juzepczukii species, as well as modern, traditional, early, medium, and late maturity-type cultivars, with a relative RMSE of 37.2% for tuber dry weight and 21.4% for tuber fresh weight. Cultivars ‘Desiree’ and ‘Atlantic’ were grown in experiments across the globe and well simulated using consistent cultivar parameters. However, the model underestimated the impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and poorly simulated high temperature effects on crop growth. Other simulated crop variables, including leaf area, stem weight, crop N, and soil water, differed frequently from measurements; some of these variables had significant large measurement errors. The SUBSTOR-potato model was shown to be suitable to simulate tuber growth and yields over a wide range of current growing conditions and crop management practices across many geographic regions. However, before the model can be used effectively in climate change impact assessments, it requires improved model routines to capture the impacts of elevated atmospheric CO2 and high temperatures on crop growth.},

While all models were accurate for maize (RRMSE from 16.5% to 25.9%), they were, to some extent, unsuitable for rapeseed. Although differences between biomass simulated by the models were generally significant for rapeseed, they were significant only in 30% of the cases for maize. This could suggest that in case of models well suited to a crop, user subjectivity (which explained 14% of total variance in maize outputs) can hide differences in model algorithms and, consequently, the uncertainty due to parameterization should be better investigated.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Some assumptions concerning development in wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) were examined. These are that (i) the rate of development towards anthesis increases linearly with temperature, (ii) the base temperature is 0°C, (iii) the optimum temperature is above the range at which wheat is normally grown, (iv) base and optimum temperatures do not change with development, and (v) the relationships for different cultivars are similar. We tested these assumptions in studies using a naturally lit phytotron with four cultivars and six temperature regimes between 10 and 25°C. Seedlings were vernalized for 50 d and then grown under a photoperiod of 18 h to avoid confounding the responses to vernalization and photoperiod with those to temperature. In cultivars Sunset and Rosella, the rate of development for the full period to anthesis increased linearly between base and optimum temperatures. However, in cultivars Condor and Cappelle Desprez, a linear fit was not statistically acceptable. For these cultivars, the rate of development towards anthesis increased rapidly with increase in temperature from 10 to 19°C, but temperatures higher than 19°C had little or no fürther accelerating effect. When a linear relationship was fitted by ignoring data for temperatures above 19 7deg;C, base temperatures calculated for the full period to anthesis were c. 5.5, 5.5,4.0 and 2.5°C for Sunset, Condor, Rosella and Cappelle Desprez, respectively (i.e. an average value of c. 4 7deg;C). The full period to anthesis was subdivided into three phases for fürther analysis. These were (i) from the beginning of the experiment to terminal spikelet initiation, (ii) from terminal spikelet initiation to heading, and (iii) from heading to anthesis. When these sub-phases were analysed a linear relationship was found to be appropriate for all combinations of cultivar and developmental phase. However, both base and optimum temperatures calculated from the relationships increased as development progressed from (i) to (iii). Averaging across cultivars, base temperatures for the three phases were -1.9, \%1.2 and \%8.1°C, respectively, while optimum temperatures were <22, 25 and >25°C, respectively. Cultivars differed substantially in all these parameters. The progressive increase in optimum temperature with phasic development was apparently the main reason why linear fits for the three sub-phases became a curvilinear fit for the full phase to anthesis.},

  abstract = {Water stress in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) causes considerable losses in yield, and therefore, potato is often considered to be a drought sensitive crop. Identification of water deficit tolerant potato genotypes is an adaptation strategy to mitigate the climatic changes that are occurring in the Cundiboyacense region in Colombia. Previous studies have evaluated potato plants under water stress conditions using physiological analyses. However, these methodologies require considerable amounts of time and plant material to perform these measurements. This study evaluated and compared the physiological and spectral traits between two genotypes, Diacol Capiro and Perla Negra under two drought levels (10 and 15 days without irrigation from flowering). Reflectance information was used to calculate indexes which were associated with the physiological behavior in plants. The results showed that spectral information was correlated ($\rho$ {\textless} 0.0001) with physiological variables such as foliar area (FA), total water content (H2Ot), relative growth rate of potato tubers (RGTtub), leaf area ratio (LAR), and foliar area index (AFI). In general, there was a higher concentration of chlorophyll under drought treatments. In addition, Perla Negra under water deficit treatments did not show significant differences in its physiological variables. Therefore, it could be considered a drought tolerant genotype because its physiological performance was not affected under water stress conditions. However, yield was affected in both genotypes after being subject to 15 days of drought. The results suggested that reflectance indexes are a useful and affordable approach for potato phenotyping to select parent and segregant populations in breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Many algorithms have been developed for the remote estimation of biophysical characteristics of vegetation, in terms of combinations of spectral bands, derivatives of reflectance spectra, neural networks, inversion of radiative transfer models, and several multi-spectral statistical approaches. However, the most widespread type of algorithm used is the mathematical combination of visible and near-infrared reflectance bands, in the form of spectral vegetation indices. Applications of such vegetation indices have ranged from leaves to the entire globe, but in many instances, their applicability is specific to species, vegetation types or local conditions. The general objective of this study is to evaluate different vegetation indices for the remote estimation of the green leaf area index (Green LAI) of two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. Among the indices tested, the chlorophyll Indices (the CIGreen, the CIRed-edge and the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index, MTCI) exhibited strong and significant linear relationships with Green LAI, and thus were sensitive across the entire range of Green LAI evaluated (i.e., 0.0 to more than 6.0m2/m2). However, the CIRed-edge was the only index insensitive to crop type and produced the most accurate estimations of Green LAI in both crops (RMSE=0.577m2/m2). These results were obtained using data acquired with close range sensors (i.e., field spectroradiometers mounted 6m above the canopy) and an aircraft-mounted hyperspectral imaging spectroradiometer (AISA). As the CIRed-edge also exhibited low sensitivity to soil background effects, it constitutes a simple, yet robust tool for the remote and synoptic estimation of Green LAI. Algorithms based on this index may not require re-parameterization when applied to crops with different canopy architectures and leaf structures, but further studies are required for assessing its applicability in other vegetation types (e.g., forests, grasslands).},

  abstract = {Our objective was to define sensitive morphological indicators that could be used to discriminate between drought sensitive and drought tolerant potato cultivars before final tuber yield is reached. A total of six potato cultivars contrasting for drought tolerance and earliness were subjected to three levels of water supply in two field trials in 1995 and 1996. We examined which parameter among stem height, number of green leaves and leaf length (the two latter parameters were only measured on two cultivars) was most sensitive to moderate drought conditions and responded similarly to water shortage regarding tuber yield, tuber number and average tuber dry weight. Drought reduced the number of green leaves in cultivars Krostar and Désirée, respectively, up to 22 and 25% 124 days after planting during the season but this effect levelled off towards the end of the season. Drought also induced significant length reductions (29, 43 and 53%, respectively, for the leaf numbers 17, 18 and 19) but there were no differences among the two cultivars examined. Stem height was sensitive to drought and the effect was stronger on later cultivars especially when water shortage started early as in 1996. In 1996, stem height ratios were negatively related (R2=0.80) to TDWS (tuber yield ratio indicative of drought tolerance) whereas they were positively related in 1995 (R2=0.21). However, care is needed as the negative relationship of 1996 was associated to earliness of cultivars. Indeed, stem height was less reduced in early cultivars (13 and 14% for Eersteling and Jaerla, respectively) than in mid-late cultivars (25 and 29% for Désirée and Nicola, respectively). In the drought treatment, no supernumerary tuber was observed across the season contrary to the irrigated treatment. According to the year, final tuber number or average tuber dry weight was reduced by the drought treatment. Reduction in tuber number (17%) in the drought treatment was not associated to lower tuber yields due to compensation by average tuber dry weight (6%). Different growth strategies can be followed by the potato plant to adapt to different drought conditions without tuber yield being significantly affected.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is a key determinant of plant productivity. A shortage of N can give three responses: (1) reduce leaf area (light capture) and maintain leaf N content (photosynthetic capacity); (2) maintain leaf area and reduce leaf N content; or (3) a combination of these responses. We examined these responses in contrasting crop canopies. Forage rape (C3 dicotyledons), wheat (C3 monocotyledons) and forage sorghum (C4 monocotyledons) were grown with fertiliser N supplies of 0, 50, 100 or 200kgN/ha. Crop biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception were measured regularly, while accumulated intercepted PAR and radiation use efficiency (RUE) were calculated. Each crop exhibited distinct functional responses of biomass production to N shortage. For all crops specific leaf N (SLN), RUE, LAI and PAR capture were reduced in response to N shortage. However, the extent of the response differed between species. The SLN and RUE were reduced to a greater extent in forage rape than in wheat. In contrast, the LAI and PAR capture were reduced to a greater extent in wheat than in forage rape. Sorghum was intermediate between these two crops. Leaf inclination could account for these distinct responses – with forage rape's more horizontally inclined leaves, a change in LAI has a much smaller effect on PAR interception compared with wheat and sorghum. Under N shortage the amount of PAR intercepted per unit leaf N increased in forage rape but not in the other two crops. Alternatively leaf structure could account for these distinct responses – forage rape has larger petioles and midribs than wheat. Petioles and midribs have a large N content but only a small area, therefore to achieve given RUE, forage rape requires an extra 1.2gN/m2 leaf than wheat. Therefore the functional response that maximised growth under limited N supply was to reduce SLN and RUE to a greater extent than LAI and PAR interception for forage rape; reduce LAI and PAR interception to a greater extent than SLN and RUE for wheat; and reduce both RUE and LAI for sorghum to a similar extent. These were the observed responses for each species.},

In tomato, mutations blocking the transition to ripe fruits have provided insights into the role of ethylene and its associated molecular networks involved in the control of ripening. However, the role of other plant hormones is still poorly understood. In this review, we describe how plant hormones, transcription factors, and epigenetic changes are intimately related to provide a tight control of the ripening process.

The objectives of this study were to (a) assess the future impact of climate change on cacao in Peru and (b) identify areas where climate change-tolerant genotypes are potentially present. Location Peru Methods Drawing on 19,700 and 1,200 presence points of cultivated and wild cacao, respectively, we modelled their suitability distributions using multiple ensemble models constructed based on both random and target group selection of pseudo-absence points and different resolutions of spatial filtering. To estimate the uncertainty of future predictions, we generated future projections for all the ensemble models. We investigated the potential emergence of novel climates, determined expected changes in ecogeographical zones (zones representative for particular sets of growth conditions) and carried out an outlier analysis based on the environmental variables most relevant for climate change adaptation to identify areas where climate change-tolerant genotypes are potentially present. Results We found that the best modelling approaches differed between cultivated and wild cacao and that the resolution of spatial filtering had a strong impact on future suitability predictions, calling for careful evaluation of the effect of model selection on modelling results. Overall, our models foresee a contraction of suitable area for cultivated cacao while predicting a more positive future for wild cacao in Peru. Ecogeographical zones are expected to change in 8\%–16\% of the distribution of cultivated and wild cacao. We identified several areas where climate change-tolerant genotypes may be present in Peru. Main conclusions Our results indicate that tolerant genotypes will be required to facilitate the adaptation of cacao cultivation under climate change. The identified cacao populations will be target of collection missions.},
