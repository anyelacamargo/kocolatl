  abstract = {Predicting climate change impact on ecosystem structure and services is one of the most important challenges in ecology. Until now, plant species response to climate change has been described at the level of fixed plant functional types, an approach limited by its inflexibility as there is much interspecific functional variation within plant functional types. Considering a plant species as a set of functional traits greatly increases our possibilities for analysis of ecosystem functioning and carbon and nutrient fluxes associated therewith. Moreover, recently assembled large-scale databases hold comprehensive per-species data on plant functional traits, allowing a detailed functional description of many plant communities on Earth. Here, we show that plant functional traits can be used as predictors of vegetation response to climate warming, accounting in our test ecosystem (the species-rich alpine belt of Caucasus mountains, Russia) for 59% of variability in the per-species abundance relation to temperature. In this mountain belt, traits that promote conservative leaf water economy (higher leaf mass per area, thicker leaves) and large investments in belowground reserves to support next year�s shoot buds (root carbon content) were the best predictors of the species increase in abundance along with temperature increase. This finding demonstrates that plant functional traits constitute a highly useful concept for forecasting changes in plant communities, and their associated ecosystem services, in response to climate change.},

  abstract  = {Functional mapping has been a powerful tool in mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying dynamic traits of agricultural or biomedical interest. In functional mapping, multivariate normality is often assumed for the underlying data distribution, partially due to the ease of parameter estimation. The normality assumption however could be easily violated in real applications due to various reasons such as heavy tails or extreme observations. Departure from normality has negative effect on testing power and inference for QTL identification. In this work, we relax the normality assumption and propose a robust multivariate -distribution mapping framework for QTL identification in functional mapping. Simulation studies show increased mapping power and precision with the  distribution than that of a normal distribution. The utility of the method is demonstrated through a real data analysis.},

  abstract  = {In genetic studies, many interesting traits, including growth curves and skeletal shape, have temporal or spatial structure. They are better treated as curves or function-valued traits. Identification of genetic loci contributing to such traits is facilitated by specialized methods that explicitly address the function-valued nature of the data. Current methods for mapping function-valued traits are mostly likelihood-based, requiring specification of the distribution and error structure. However, such specification is difficult or impractical in many scenarios. We propose a general functional regression approach based on estimating equations that is robust to misspecification of the covariance structure. Estimation is based on a two-step least-squares algorithm, which is fast and applicable even when the number of time points exceeds the number of samples. It is also flexible due to a general linear functional model; changing the number of covariates does not necessitate a new set of formulas and programs. In addition, many meaningful extensions are straightforward. For example, we can accommodate incomplete genotype data, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. The framework is an attractive alternative to likelihood-based methods when the covariance structure of the data is not known. It provides a good compromise between model simplicity, statistical efficiency, and computational speed. We illustrate our method and its advantages using circadian mouse behavioral data.},

  abstract  = {Many quantitative traits are measured repeatedly during the life of an organism. Such traits are called dynamic traits. The pattern of the changes of a dynamic trait is called the growth trajectory. Studying the growth trajectory may enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of the growth trajectory. Recently, we developed an interval-mapping procedure to map QTL for dynamic traits under the maximum-likelihood framework. We fit the growth trajectory by Legendre polynomials. The method intended to map one QTL at a time and the entire QTL analysis involved scanning the entire genome by fitting multiple single-QTL models. In this study, we propose a Bayesian shrinkage analysis for estimating and mapping multiple QTL in a single model. The method is a combination between the shrinkage mapping for individual quantitative traits and the Legendre polynomial analysis for dynamic traits. The multiple-QTL model is implemented in two ways: (1) a fixed-interval approach where a QTL is placed in each marker interval and (2) a moving-interval approach where the position of a QTL can be searched in a range that covers many marker intervals. Simulation study shows that the Bayesian shrinkage method generates much better signals for QTL than the interval-mapping approach. We propose several alternative methods to present the results of the Bayesian shrinkage analysis. In particular, we found that the Wald test-statistic profile can serve as a mechanism to test the significance of a putative QTL.},

  abstract  = {Quantitative traits whose phenotypic values change over time are called longitudinal traits. Genetic analyses of longitudinal traits can be conducted using any of the following approaches: (1) treating the phenotypic values at different time points as repeated measurements of the same trait and analyzing the trait under the repeated measurements framework, (2) treating the phenotypes measured from different time points as different traits and analyzing the traits jointly on the basis of the theory of multivariate analysis, and (3) fitting a growth curve to the phenotypic values across time points and analyzing the fitted parameters of the growth trajectory under the theory of multivariate analysis. The third approach has been used in QTL mapping for longitudinal traits by fitting the data to a logistic growth trajectory. This approach applies only to the particular S-shaped growth process. In practice, a longitudinal trait may show a trajectory of any shape. We demonstrate that one can describe a longitudinal trait with orthogonal polynomials, which are sufficiently general for fitting any shaped curve. We develop a mixed-model methodology for QTL mapping of longitudinal traits and a maximum-likelihood method for parameter estimation and statistical tests. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to search for the maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters. The method is verified with simulated data and demonstrated with experimental data from a pseudobackcross family of Populus (poplar) trees.},

It should be possible therefore to use such approaches to select robust genotypes. However, plants are morphologically complex and identification of meaningful traits from automatically acquired image data is not straightforward. Bespoke algorithms can be designed to capture and/or quantitate specific features but this approach is inflexible and is not generally applicable to a wide range of traits. In this paper, we have used industry-standard computer vision techniques to extract a wide range of features from images of genetically diverse Arabidopsis rosettes growing under non-stimulated conditions, and then used statistical analysis to identify those features that provide good discrimination between ecotypes. This analysis indicates that almost all the observed shape variation can be described by 5 principal components. We describe an easily implemented pipeline including image segmentation, feature extraction and statistical analysis. This pipeline provides a cost-effective and inherently scalable method to parameterise and analyse variation in rosette shape. The acquisition of images does not require any specialised equipment and the computer routines for image processing and data analysis have been implemented using open source software. Source code for data analysis is written using the R package. The equations to calculate image descriptors have been also provided.},

We describe the creation and validation of an eight-parent MAGIC population consisting of 1091 F(7) lines of winter-sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analyses based on genotypes from a 90,000-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array find the population to be well-suited as a platform for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene isolation. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) show the population to be highly recombined; genetic marker diversity among the founders was 74% of that captured in a larger set of 64 wheat varieties, and 54% of SNPs segregating among the 64 lines also segregated among the eight founder lines. In contrast, a commonly used reference bi-parental population had only 54% of the diversity of the 64 varieties with 27% of SNPs segregating. We demonstrate the potential of this MAGIC resource by identifying a highly diagnostic marker for the morphological character "awn presence/absence" and independently validate it in an association-mapping panel. These analyses show this large, diverse, and highly recombined MAGIC population to be a powerful resource for the genetic dissection of target traits in wheat, and it is well-placed to efficiently exploit ongoing advances in phenomics and genomics.

  abstract = {The appropriate timing of developmental transitions is critical for adapting many crops to their local climatic conditions. Therefore, understanding the genetic basis of different aspects of phenology could be useful in highlighting mechanisms underpinning adaptation, with implications in breeding for climate change. For bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, the start and rate of leaf senescence and the relative timing of different stages of flowering and grain filling all contribute to plant performance. In this study we screened under Smart house conditions a large, multi-founder ‘NIAB elite MAGIC’ wheat population, to evaluate the genetic elements that influence the timing of developmental stages in European elite varieties. This panel of recombinant inbred lines was derived from eight parents that are or recently have been grown commercially in the UK and Northern Europe. We undertook a detailed temporal phenotypic analysis under Smart house conditions of the population and its parents, to try to identify known or novel Quantitative Trait Loci associated with variation in the timing of key phenological stages in senescence. This analysis resulted in the detection of QTL interactions with novel traits such the time between ‘half of ear emergence above flag leaf ligule’ and the onset of senescence at the flag leaf as well as traits associated with plant morphology such as stem height. In addition, strong correlations between several traits and the onset of senescence of the flag leaf were identified. This work establishes the value of systematically phenotyping genetically unstructured populations to reveal the genetic architecture underlying morphological variation in commercial wheat.},

  abstract = {High-resolution mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in
 animals has proved to be difficult because the large effect sizes
 detected in crosses between inbred strains are often caused by numerous
 linked QTLs, each of small effect. In a study of fearfulness in mice,
 we have shown it is possible to fine map small-effect QTLs in a
 genetically heterogeneous stock (HS). This strategy is a powerful
 general method of fine mapping QTLs, provided QTLs detected in crosses
 between inbred strains that formed the HS can be reliably detected in
 the HS. We show here that single-marker association analysis identifies
 only two of five QTLs expected to be segregating in the HS and
 apparently limits the strategy's usefulness for fine mapping. We solve
 this problem with a multipoint analysis that assigns the probability
 that an allele descends from each progenitor in the HS. The analysis
 does not use pedigrees but instead requires information about the HS
 founder haplotypes. With this method we mapped all three previously
 undetected loci [chromosome (Chr.) 1 logP 4.9, Chr. 10 logP 6.0, Chr.
 15 logP 4.0]. We show that the reason for the failure of single-marker
 association to detect QTLs is its inability to distinguish opposing
 phenotypic effects when they occur on the same marker allele. We have
 developed a robust method of fine mapping QTLs in genetically
 heterogeneous animals and suggest it is now cost effective to undertake
 genomewide high-resolution analysis of complex traits in parallel on
 the same set of mice.},

 interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the
 q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value
 is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of

 positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while
 offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for

We extend the Bayesian model selection framework for mapping multiple epistatic QTL affecting continuous traits to dynamic traits in experimental crosses. The extension inherits the efficiency of Bayesian model selection and the flexibility of the Legendre polynomial model fitting to the change in genetic and environmental effects with time. We illustrate the proposed method by simultaneously detecting the main and epistatic QTLs for the growth of leaf age in a doubled-haploid population of rice. The behavior and performance of the method are also shown by computer simulation experiments. The results show that our method can more quickly identify interacting QTLs for dynamic traits in the models with many numbers of genetic effects, enhancing our understanding of genetic architecture for dynamic traits. Our proposed method can be treated as a general form of mapping QTL for continuous quantitative traits, being easier to extend to multiple traits and to a single trait with repeat records.},

The morphology for all samples matched that of Puccinia kuehnii or P. melanocephala, the orange and brown rust pathogens of sugarcane, respectively. Nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (rDNA) including portions of the 5.8S rDNA, the complete internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and 5{\textasciiacutex} region of the large subunit (nLSU) rDNA were obtained for each species along with 36 additional rust taxa. Despite a shared host, the two Puccinia spp. on sugarcane are not closely related within the Pucciniales. Phylogenetic analyses place P. melanocephala most closely to P. miscanthi, P. nakanishikii, and P. rufipes infecting Miscanthus sinensis, Cymbopogon citratus, and Imperata cylindrica, respectively. Puccinia kuehnii is basal to a clade of Poaceae-infecting rusts including P. agrophila, P. polysora, P. substriata, and Uromyces setariae-italicae infecting Schizachyrium spp., Zea mays, Digitaria spp., and Urochloa mosambicensis, respectively. Light and scanning electron microscopy images highlight morphological differences distinguishing the two sugarcane-infecting species.

  abstract = {Bacteria develop resistance to many classes of antibiotics vertically, by engendering mutations in genes encoding transcriptional and translational apparatus. These severe adaptations affect global transcription, translation, and the correspondingly affected metabolism. Here, we characterize metabolome scale changes in transcriptional and translational mutants in a genomically characterized Nocardiopsis, a soil-derived actinomycete, in stationary phase. Analysis of ultra-performance liquid chromatography�ion mobility�mass spectrometry metabolomic features from a cohort of streptomycin- and rifampicin-resistant mutants grown in the absence of antibiotics exhibits clear metabolomic speciation, and loadings analysis catalogs a marked change in metabolic phenotype. Consistent with derepression, up to 311 features are observed in antibiotic-resistant mutants that are not detected in their progenitors. Mutants demonstrate changes in primary metabolism, such as modulation of fatty acid composition and the increased production of the osmoprotectant ectoine, in addition to the presence of abundant emergent potential secondary metabolites. Isolation of three of these metabolites followed by structure elucidation demonstrates them to be an unusual polyketide family with a previously uncharacterized xanthene framework resulting from sequential oxidative carbon skeletal rearrangements. Designated as �mutaxanthenes,� this family can be correlated to a type II polyketide gene cluster in the producing organism. Taken together, these data suggest that biosynthetic pathway derepression is a general consequence of some antibiotic resistance mutations.},

  abstract  = {Multi-target regulators represent a largely untapped area for metabolic engineering and anti-bacterial development. These regulators are complex to characterize because they often act at multiple levels, affecting proteins, transcripts and metabolites. Therefore, single omics experiments cannot profile their underlying targets and mechanisms. In this work, we used an Integrative FourD omics approach (INFO) that consists of collecting and analyzing systems data throughout multiple time points, using multiple genetic backgrounds, and multiple omics approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics and high throughput sequencing crosslinking immunoprecipitation) to evaluate simultaneous changes in gene expression after imposing an environmental stress that accentuates the regulatory features of a network. Using this approach, we profiled the targets and potential regulatory mechanisms of a global regulatory system, the well-studied carbon storage regulatory (Csr) system of Escherichia coli, which is widespread among bacteria. Using 126 sets of proteomics and transcriptomics data, we identified 136 potential direct CsrA targets, including 50 novel ones, categorized their behaviors into distinct regulatory patterns, and performed in vivo fluorescence-based follow up experiments. The results of this work validate 17 novel mRNAs as authentic direct CsrA targets and demonstrate a generalizable strategy to integrate multiple lines of omics data to identify a core pool of regulator targets.},

Understanding and evaluating the epidemic risks due to spread of yellow leaf by aphids is an important feature for sugarcane production. Four distinct sugarcane trials were set up with disease-free plants to study the relationship between spread of yellow leaf, the vector dynamics and environmental conditions that may favour yellow leaf epidemics. The study was performed by surveys of vector populations and determination of plant infections. Sugarcane cultivar SP71-6163, highly susceptible to yellow leaf, was analyzed spatially at different dates in all four trials and compared to commercial cultivars in two of the four trials. These surveys allowed us to identify a correlation between the aphid dynamics in the field and yellow leaf progress. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between rainfall during the first weeks after transferring sugarcane plants to the field and aphid dispersal within the field. This later result revealed an impact of rainfall on aphid invasion and subsequent plant infection by SCYLV. If aphids are the key factor for disease spread, plant response varied also according to cultivar resistance with high variation depending on rain conditions.},

The database constructed contained 2328 unique geo-located entries on Medfly detection sites from 43 countries and nearly 500 unique localities, as well as information on hosts, life stages and capture method. Of these, 125 localities had information on the month when Medfly was recorded and these data were complemented by additional material found in comprehensive databases available online. Records from 1980 until present were used for medfly environmental niche modeling. Maximum Entropy Algorithm (MaxEnt) and a set of seasonally varying environmental covariates were used to predict the fundamental niche of the Medfly on a global scale. Three seasonal maps were also produced: January-April, May-August and September-December. Models performed significantly better than random achieving high accuracy scores, indicating a good discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the presence of the species.},

  abstract  = {Papaya meleira virus (PMeV) is the causal agent of papaya sticky disease, which is characterized by a spontaneous exudation of fluid and aqueous latex from the papaya fruit and leaves. The latex oxidizes after atmospheric exposure, resulting in a sticky feature on the fruit from which the name of the disease originates. PMeV is an isometric virus particle with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome of approximately 12 Kb. Unusual for a plant virus, PMeV particles are localized on and linked to the polymers present in the latex. The ability of the PMeV to inhabit such a hostile environment demonstrates an intriguing interaction of the virus with the papaya. A hypersensitivity response is triggered against PMeV infection, and there is a reduction in the proteolytic activity of papaya latex during sticky disease. In papaya leaf tissues, stress responsive proteins, mostly calreticulin and proteasome-related proteins, are up regulated and proteins related to metabolism are down-regulated. Additionally, PMeV modifies the transcription of several miRNAs involved in the modulation of genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Until now, no PMeV resistant papaya genotype has been identified and roguing is the only viral control strategy available. However, a single inoculation of papaya plants with PMeV dsRNA delayed the progress of viral infection.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Genomics and proteomics analyses regularly involve the simultaneous test of hundreds of hypotheses, either on numerical or categorical data. To correct for the occurrence of false positives, validation tests based on multiple testing correction, such as Bonferroni and Benjamini and Hochberg, and re-sampling, such as permutation tests, are frequently used. Despite the known power of permutation-based tests, most available tools offer such tests for either t-test or ANOVA only. Less attention has been given to tests for categorical data, such as the Chi-square. This project takes a first step by developing an open-source software tool, Ptest, that addresses the need to offer public software tools incorporating these and other statistical tests with options for correcting for multiple hypotheses. RESULTS: This study developed a public-domain, user-friendly software whose purpose was twofold: first, to estimate test statistics for categorical and numerical data; and second, to validate the significance of the test statistics via Bonferroni, Benjamini and Hochberg, and a permutation test of numerical and categorical data. The tool allows the calculation of Chi-square test for categorical data, and ANOVA test, Bartlett's test and t-test for paired and unpaired data. Once a test statistic is calculated, Bonferroni, Benjamini and Hochberg, and a permutation tests are implemented, independently, to control for Type I errors. An evaluation of the software using different public data sets is reported, which illustrates the power of permutation tests for multiple hypotheses assessment and for controlling the rate of Type I errors. CONCLUSION: The analytical options offered by the software can be applied to support a significant spectrum of hypothesis testing tasks in functional genomics, using both numerical and categorical data.},

  abstract  = {Heading of cereals is determined by complex genetic and environmental factors in which genes responsible for vernalization and photoperiod sensitivity play a decisive role. Our aim was to use diagnostic molecular markers to determine the main allele types in VRN-A1, VRN-B1, VRN-D1, PPD-B1 and PPD-D1 in a worldwide wheat collection of 683 genotypes and to investigate the effect of these alleles on heading in the field. The dominant VRN-A1, VRN-B1 and VRN-D1 alleles were present at a low frequency. The PPD-D1a photoperiod-insensitive allele was carried by 57 % of the cultivars and was most frequent in Asian and European cultivars. The PPD-B1 photoperiod-insensitive allele was carried by 22 % of the genotypes from Asia, America and Europe. Nine versions of the PPD-B1-insensitive allele were identified based on gene copy number and intercopy structure. The allele compositions in PPD-D1, PPD-B1 and VRN-D1 significantly influenced heading and together explained 37.5 % of the phenotypic variance. The role of gene model increased to 39.1 % when PPD-B1 intercopy structure was taken into account instead of overall PPD-B1 type (sensitive vs. insensitive). As a single component, PPD-D1 had the most important role (28.0 % of the phenotypic variance), followed by PPD-B1 (12.3 % for PPD-B1_overall, and 15.1 % for PPD-B1_intercopy) and VRN-D1 (2.2 %). Significant gene interactions were identified between the marker alleles within PPD-B1 and between VRN-D1 and the two PPD1 genes. The earliest heading genotypes were those with the photoperiod-insensitive allele in PPD-D1 and PPD-B1, and with the spring allele for VRN-D1 and the winter alleles for VRN-A1 and VRN-B1. This combination could only be detected in genotypes from Southern Europe and Asia. Late-heading genotypes had the sensitivity alleles for both PPD1 genes, regardless of the allelic composition of the VRN1 genes. There was a 10-day difference in heading between the earliest and latest groups under field conditions.

  abstract = {In 1994, LINTUL-POTATO was published, a comprehensive model of potato development and growth. The mechanistic model simulated early crop processes (emergence and leaf expansion) and light interception until extinction, through leaf layers. Photosynthesis and respiration in a previous crop growth model---SUCROS---were substituted by a temperature-dependent light use efficiency. Leaf senescence at initial crop stages was simulated by allowing a longevity per daily leaf class formed, and crop senescence started when all daily dry matter production was allocated to the tubers, leaving none for the foliage. The model performed well in, e.g., ideotyping studies. For other studies such as benchmarking production environments, agro-ecological zoning, climatic hazards, climate change, and yield gap analysis, the need was felt to develop from the original LINTUL-POTATO, a derivative LINTUL-POTATO-DSS with fewer equations---reducing the potential sources of error in calculations---and fewer parameters. This reduces the number of input parameters as well as the amount of data required that for many reasons are not available or not reliable. In LINTUL-POTATO-DSS calculating potential yields, initial crop development depends on a fixed temperature sum for ground cover development from 0{\%} at emergence to 100{\%}. Light use efficiency is temperature dependent. Dry matter distribution to the tubers starts at tuber initiation and linearly increases up to a fixed harvest index which is reached at crop end. Crop end is input of the model: it is assumed that the crop cycle determined by maturity matches the length of the available frost-free and or heat-free cropping season. LINTUL-POTATO-DSS includes novel calculations to explore tuber quality characteristics such as tuber size distribution and dry matter concentration depending on crop environment and management.},

  abstract  = {In biology, many quantitative traits are dynamic in nature. They can often be described by some smooth functions or curves. A joint analysis of all the repeated measurements of the dynamic traits by functional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping methods has the benefits to (1) understand the genetic control of the whole dynamic process of the quantitative traits and (2) improve the statistical power to detect QTL. One crucial issue in functional QTL mapping is how to correctly describe the smoothness of trajectories of functional valued traits. We develop an efficient Bayesian nonparametric multiple-loci procedure for mapping dynamic traits. The method uses the Bayesian P-splines with (nonparametric) B-spline bases to specify the functional form of a QTL trajectory and a random walk prior to automatically determine its degree of smoothness. An efficient deterministic variational Bayes algorithm is used to implement both (1) the search of an optimal subset of QTL among large marker panels and (2) estimation of the genetic effects of the selected QTL changing over time. Our method can be fast even on some large-scale data sets. The advantages of our method are illustrated on both simulated and real data sets.},

This study compared three RS approaches using a low flying UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), with that of proximal sensing, and satellite-based imagery. Two physiological traits were considered, canopy temperature (CT) and a vegetation index (NDVI), to determine the most viable approaches for large scale crop genetic improvement. The UAV-based platform achieves plot-level resolution while measuring several hundred plots in one mission via high-resolution thermal and multispectral imagery measured at altitudes of 30-100 m. The satellite measures multispectral imagery from an altitude of 770 km. Information was compared with proximal measurements using IR thermometers and an NDVI sensor at a distance of 0.5-1 m above plots. For robust comparisons, CT and NDVI were assessed on panels of elite cultivars under irrigated and drought conditions, in different thermal regimes, and on un-adapted genetic resources under water deficit. Correlations between airborne data and yield/biomass at maturity were generally higher than equivalent proximal correlations. NDVI was derived from high-resolution satellite imagery for only larger sized plots (8.5 × 2.4 m) due to restricted pixel density. Results support use of UAV-based RS techniques for high-throughput phenotyping for both precision and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {In many clinical decision support systems, a two-layer knowledge base model (disease-symptom) of rule reasoning is used. This model often does not express knowledge very well since it simply infers disease from the presence of certain symptoms. In this study, we propose a three-layer knowledge base model (disease-symptom-property) to utilize more useful information in inference. The system iteratively calculates the probability of patients who may suffer from diseases based on a multisymptom naive Bayes algorithm, in which the specificity of these disease symptoms is weighted by the estimation of the degree of contribution to diagnose the disease. It significantly reduces the dependencies between attributes to apply the naive Bayes algorithm more properly. Then, the online learning process for parameter optimization of the inference engine was completed. At last, our decision support system utilizing the three-layer model was formally evaluated by two experienced doctors. By comparisons between prediction results and clinical results, our system can provide effective clinical recommendations to doctors. Moreover, we found that the three-layer model can improve the accuracy of predictions compared with the two-layer model. In light of some of the limitations of this study, we also identify and discuss several areas that need continued improvement.},

  abstract = {Crop simulation models have a pivotal role to play in evaluating irrigation management strategies for improving agricultural water use. The objective of this study was to test and validate the AquaCrop model for maize under deficit irrigation management. Field observations from three experiments consisting of four treatments were used to evaluate model performance in simulating canopy cover (CC), biomass (B), yield (Y), crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and water use efficiency (WUE). Statistics for root mean square error, model efficiency (E), and index of agreement for B and CC suggest that the model prediction is good under non-stressed and moderate stress environments. Prediction of final B and Y under these conditions was acceptable, as indicated by the high coefficient of determination and deviations &lt;10%. In severely stressed conditions, low E and deviations &gt;11% for B and 9% for Y indicate a reduction in the model reliability. Simulated ETc and WUE deviation from observed values were within the range of 9.5% to 22.2% and 6.0% to 32.2%, respectively, suggesting that AquaCrop prediction of these variables is fair, becoming unsatisfactory as plant water stress intensifies. AquaCrop can be reliably used for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed irrigation management strategies for maize; however, the limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the results in severely stressed conditions.},

However, climate change will affect the distribution of agricultural production and, therefore, food supply and global markets. Here we quantify the structural changes in the global agricultural trade network under the two contrasting greenhouse gas emissions scenarios by coupling seven Global Gridded Crop Models and five Earth System Models to a global dynamic economic model. Our results suggest that global trade patterns of agricultural commodities may be significantly different from today’s reality with or without carbon mitigation. More specifically, the agricultural trade network becomes more centralised under the high CO2 emissions scenario, with a few regions dominating the markets. Under the carbon mitigation scenario, the trade network is more distributed and more regions are involved as either importers or exporters. Theoretically, the more distributed the structure of a network, the less vulnerable the system is to climatic or institutional shocks. Mitigating CO2 emissions has the co-benefit of creating a more stable agricultural trade system that may be better able to reduce food insecurity.},

  abstract = {Winter wheat is the main crop on the North China Plain (NCP), and in this region the most limiting factor for the crop is water. The objective of this study was to adapt and test the ability of the FAO-developed AquaCrop model (v3.1) to simulate winter wheat grain yield, biomass, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and total soil water content (0-120cm). Field experiments were conducted under deficit irrigation at the Luancheng Agro-ecosystem station (NCP) in 1998-2001, and the AquaCrop model was calibrated with treatment D (1999-2000); the rest of the data was used for validation of the model. The AquaCrop model was revalidated with data on measured grain yield from the experimental station for 1990-2010, considering actual field conditions. The second revalidation was done with the statistical grain yield for 1995-2010 in the study region. For the model validation, the significant differences between simulated and observed grain yield, biomass and ETa were in the order of: rainfed treatment>well-watered treatment>moderate water stress. Total soil water simulated by AquaCrop tends to follow closely the trend in the measured data, but with slight underestimations for irrigated treatments and significant overestimations for rainfed treatments. In general, errors in the model's evaluation such as RMSE and Willmot's d statistics were for grain yield (0.58Mgha−1, 0.92), biomass (0.87Mgha−1, 0.95), ETa (33.2mm, 0.93) and soil water content (24.5-37.6mm, 0.85-0.90). The overall results based on extensive validation and revalidation showed that AquaCrop is a valid model and can be used with a reliable degree of accuracy for optimizing winter wheat grain yield production and water requirement on the NCP.},

Leaf senescence involves a coordinated action at the cellular, tissue, organ, and organism levels under the control of a highly regulated genetic program. Major breakthroughs in the molecular understanding of leaf senescence were achieved through characterization of various senescence mutants and senescence-associated genes, which revealed the nature of regulatory factors and a highly complex molecular regulatory network underlying leaf senescence. The genetically identified regulatory factors include transcription regulators, receptors and signaling components for hormones and stress responses, and regulators of metabolism. Key issues still need to be elucidated, including cellular-level analysis of senescence-associated cell death, the mechanism of coordination among cellular-, organ-, and organism-level senescence, the integration mechanism of various senescence-affecting signals, and the nature and control of leaf age. },

  abstract = {Abstract Senescence is the final stage of plant ontogeny before death. Senescence may occur naturally because of age or may be induced by various endogenous and exogenous factors. Despite its destructive character, senescence is a precisely controlled process that follows a well-defined order. It is often inseparable from programmed cell death (PCD), and a correlation between these processes has been confirmed during the senescence of leaves and petals. Despite suggestions that senescence and PCD are two separate processes, with PCD occurring after senescence, cell death responsible for senescence is accompanied by numerous changes at the cytological, physiological and molecular levels, similar to other types of PCD. Independent of the plant organ analysed, these changes are focused on initiating the processes of cellular structural degradation via fluctuations in phytohormone levels and the activation of specific genes. Cellular structural degradation is genetically programmed and dependent on autophagy. Phytohormones/plant regulators are heavily involved in regulating the senescence of plant organs and can either promote [ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), and polyamines (PAs)] or inhibit [cytokinins (CKs)] this process. Auxins and carbohydrates have been assigned a dual role in the regulation of senescence, and can both inhibit and stimulate the senescence process. In this review, we introduce the basic pathways that regulate senescence in plants and identify mechanisms involved in controlling senescence in ephemeral plant organs. Moreover, we demonstrate a universal nature of this process in different plant organs; despite this process occurring in organs that have completely different functions, it is very similar. Progress in this area is providing opportunities to revisit how, when and which way senescence is coordinated or decoupled by plant regulators in different organs and will provide a powerful tool for plant physiology research.},

  year     = {2014},
  abstract = {Research on polyamines in plants laps a long way of about 50 years and many roles have been discovered for these aliphatic cations. Polyamines regulate cell division, differentiation, organogenesis, reproduction, dormancy-break and senescence, homeostatic adjustments in response to external stimuli and stresses. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of their multiple activities are still matter of research. Polyamines are present in free and bound forms and interact with several important cell molecules; some of these interactions may occur by covalent linkages catalyzed by transglutaminase, giving rise to ‘cationisation’ or cross-links among specific proteins. Senescence and PCD can be delayed by polyamines; in order to re-interpret some of these effects and to obtain new insights into their molecular mechanisms, their conjugation has been revised here. The transglutaminase-mediated interactions between proteins and polyamines are the main target of this review. After an introduction on the characteristics of this enzyme, on its catalysis and role in PCD in animals, the plant senescence and PCD models in which TGase has been studied, are presented: the corolla of naturally senescing or excised flowers, the leaves senescing, either excised or not, the pollen during self-incompatible pollination, the hypersensitive response and the tuber storage parenchyma during dormancy release. In all the models examined, transglutaminase appears to be involved by a similar molecular mechanism as described during apoptosis in animal cells, even though several substrates are different.  Its effect is probably related to the type of PCD, but mostly to the substrate to be modified in order to achieve the specific PCD program. As a cross-linker of polyamines and proteins, transglutaminase is an important factor involved in multiple, sometimes controversial, roles of polyamines during senescence and PCD.},

Genetic screens have identified key regulators of senescence, particularly late-stage senescence regulators. Recently, time-course gene-expression and network analyses, mostly analyses of static networks, have predicted many senescence regulators. However, senescence is defined by time-evolving networks, involving the temporal transition of interactions among senescence regulators. Here, we present time-evolving networks of NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) transcription factors, central regulators of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis, via time-course gene-expression analysis of NACs in their mutants. These time-evolving networks revealed a unique regulatory module of NACs that controls the timely induction of senescence-promoting processes at a presenescent stage of leaf aging.Senescence is controlled by time-evolving networks that describe the temporal transition of interactions among senescence regulators. Here, we present time-evolving networks for NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) transcription factors in Arabidopsis during leaf aging. The most evident characteristic of these time-dependent networks was a shift from positive to negative regulation among NACs at a presenescent stage. ANAC017, ANAC082, and ANAC090, referred to as a {\textquotedblleft}NAC troika,{\textquotedblright} govern the positive-to-negative regulatory shift. Knockout of the NAC troika accelerated senescence and the induction of other NACs, whereas overexpression of the NAC troika had the opposite effects. Transcriptome and molecular analyses revealed shared suppression of senescence-promoting processes by the NAC troika, including salicylic acid (SA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) responses, but with predominant regulation of SA and ROS responses by ANAC090 and ANAC017, respectively. Our time-evolving networks provide a unique regulatory module of presenescent repressors that direct the timely induction of senescence-promoting processes at the presenescent stage of leaf aging.},

  abstract = {Senescence is a tightly regulated developmental program coordinated by transcription factors. Identifying these transcription factors in crops will provide opportunities to tailor the senescence process to different environmental conditions and regulate the balance between yield and grain nutrient content. Here, we use ten time points of gene expression data along with gene network modeling to identify transcription factors regulating senescence in polyploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). We observe two main phases of transcriptional changes during senescence: early down-regulation of housekeeping functions and metabolic processes followed by up-regulation of transport and hormone-related genes. These two phases are largely conserved with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), although the individual genes underlying these changes are often not orthologous. We have identified transcription factor families associated with these early and later waves of differential expression. Using gene regulatory network modeling, we identified candidate transcription factors that may control senescence. Using independent, publicly available datasets, we found that the most highly ranked candidate genes in the network were enriched for senescence-related functions compared with all genes in the network. We validated the function of one of these candidate transcription factors in senescence using wheat chemically induced mutants. This study lays the groundwork to understand the transcription factors that regulate senescence in polyploid wheat and exemplifies the integration of time-series data with publicly available expression atlases and networks to identify candidate regulatory genes.},

  abstract               = {Plants are frequently wounded by mechanical impact or by insects, and their ability to adequately respond to wounding is essential for their survival and reproductive success. The wound response is mediated by a signal transduction and regulatory network. Molecular studies in Arabidopsis have identified the COI1 gene as a central component of this network. Current models of these networks qualitatively describe the wound response, but they are not directly assessed using quantitative gene expression data. We built a model comprising the key components of the Arabidopsis wound response using the transsys framework. For comparison, we constructed a null model that is devoid of any regulatory interactions, and various alternative models by rewiring the wound response model. All models were parametrized by computational optimization to generate synthetic gene expression profiles that approximate the empirical data set. We scored the fit of the synthetic to the empirical data with various distance measures, and used the median distance after optimization to directly and quantitatively assess the wound response model and its alternatives. Discrimination of candidate models depends substantially on the measure of gene expression profile distance. Using the null model to assess quality of the distance measures for discrimination, we identify correlation of log-ratio profiles as the most suitable distance. Our wound response model fits the empirical data significantly better than the alternative models. Gradual perturbation of the wound response model results in a corresponding gradual decline in fit. The optimization approach provides insights into biologically relevant features, such as robustness. It is a step toward enabling integrative studies of multiple cross-talking pathways, and thus may help to develop our understanding how the genome informs the mapping of environmental signals to phenotypic traits.},

Sorghum is presented as an example of another kind of stay-green in which perennial tendencies have been bred into a monocarpic annual crop species. Transgenic approaches are briefly discussed (enhanced endogenous cytokinins, reduced ethylene production or perception). An alternative route towards making a stay-green phenotype is through quantitative trait mapping and marker-assisted selection. Loci for greenness in pearl millet have been identified, some of which are associated with drought responses or flowering time.

  abstract  = {Abstract Leaf senescence can impact crop production by either changing photosynthesis duration, or by modifying the nutrient remobilization efficiency and harvest index. The doubling of the grain yield in major cereals in the last 50 years was primarily achieved through the extension of photosynthesis duration and the increase in crop biomass partitioning, two things that are intrinsically coupled with leaf senescence. In this review, we consider the functionality of a leaf as a function of leaf age, and divide a leaf's life into three phases: the functionality increasing phase at the early growth stage, the full functionality phase, and the senescence and functionality decreasing phase. A genetic framework is proposed to describe gene actions at various checkpoints to regulate leaf development and senescence. Four categories of genes contribute to crop production: those which regulate (I) the speed and transition of early leaf growth, (II) photosynthesis rate, (III) the onset and (IV) the progression of leaf senescence. Current advances in isolating and characterizing senescence regulatory genes are discussed in the leaf aging and crop production context. We argue that the breeding of crops with leaf senescence ideotypes should be an essential part of further crop genetic improvement. [ Hai-Chun Jing (Corresponding author)]},

  abstract               = {Senescence is a developmental process which in annual crop plants overlaps with the reproductive phase. Senescence might reduce crop yield when it is induced prematurely under adverse environmental conditions. This review covers the role of senescence for the productivity of crop plants. With the aim to enhance productivity, a number of functional stay-green cultivars have been selected by conventional breeding, in particular of sorghum and maize. In many cases, a positive correlation between leaf area duration and yield has been observed, although in a number of other cases, stay-green cultivars do not display significant effects with regards to productivity. In several crops, the stay-green phenotype is observed to be associated with a higher drought resistance and a better performance under low nitrogen conditions. Among the approaches used to achieve stay-green phenotypes in transgenic plants, the expression of the IPT gene under control of senescence-associated promoters has been the most successful. The promoters employed for senescence-regulated expression contain cis-elements for binding of WRKY transcription factors and factors controlled by abscisic acid. In most crops transformed with such constructs the stay-green character has led to increased biomass, but only in few cases to increased seed yield. A coincidence of drought stress resistance and stay-green trait is observed in many transgenic plants.},

  abstract               = {The increasing demand for food and the heavy yield losses in primary crops due to global warming mean that there is an urgent need to improve food security. Therefore, understanding how plants respond to heat stress and its consequences, such as drought and increased soil salinity, has received much attention in plant science community. Plants exhibit stress tolerance, escape or avoidance via adaptation and acclimatization mechanisms. These mechanisms rely on a high degree of plasticity in their cellular metabolism, in which phytohormones play an important role. "STAY-GREEN" is a crucial trait for genetic improvement of several crops, which allows plants to keep their leaves on the active photosynthetic level under stress conditions. Understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms concomitant with "STAY-GREEN" trait or delayed leaf senescence, as well as those regulating photosynthetic capability of plants under heat stress, with a certain focus on the hormonal pathways, may be a key to break the plateau of productivity associated with adaptation to high temperature. This review will discuss the recent findings that advance our understanding of the mechanisms controlling leaf senescence and hormone signaling cascades under heat stress.},

  abstract               = {This review examines the hypotheses that developmental programmed cell death in leaves is mediated (i) by sugar starvation in the leaf cells or (ii) by sugar accumulation in these cells. Experimental evidence for both hypotheses is critically discussed and found to be lacking. For example, some papers show that sugars prevent senescence of cut leaves placed in darkness, and prevent low sugar levels in the leaves. In these tests, the sugars seem to replace photosynthesis, hence the results have little relevance to leaf senescence in intact plants in the light. Low nitrogen nutrition and high light results in earlier senescence than the low nitrogen treatment alone. This is accompanied by high sugar levels in the leaves. The results have led to the idea that accumulation of sugars is the cause of the additional effect, or more generally, that sugar accumulation is always the direct cause of leaf senescence. Results from over-expressing, or knocking out, hexokinase genes tend to support the high sugar hypothesis, but pleiotropic effects confound this conclusion. In addition, several experiments show the effects of treatments on senescence without the increase in leaf sugar levels. Nonetheless, sugar levels are usually measured in whole leaves. Such an overall level does not reflect the differences in the onset of senescence between tissues and cells, and can therefore not be used as an argument for or against either of the two hypotheses. It is argued that future work should determine the time line of the concentrations of various sugars in various cells and cellular compartments, in relation to senescence processes in the same cells. Taken together, the data are not decisive. It is possible that neither of the two hypotheses is correct.},

Many methods have been proposed to infer networks from gene expression data but have been hampered by problems such as low sample size, inaccurate constraints, and incomplete characterizations of regulatory dynamics. Since expression regulation is dynamic, time-course data can be used to infer causality, but these datasets tend to be short or sparsely sampled. In addition, temporal methods typically assume that the expression of a gene at a time point depends on the expression of other genes at only the immediately preceding time point, while other methods include additional time points without any constraints to account for their temporal distance. These limitations can contribute to inaccurate networks with many missing and anomalous links.},

Whereas the molecular mechanisms involved in developmentally regulated leaf senescence are very well understood, in particular in the annual model plant species Arabidopsis, senescence of other organs such as the flower, fruit, and root is much less studied as well as senescence in perennials such as trees. This review addresses the need for the integration of multi-omics techniques and physiological phenotyping into holistic phenomics approaches to dissect the complex phenomenon of senescence. That became feasible through major advances in the establishment of various, complementary 'omics' technologies. Such an interdisciplinary approach will also need to consider knowledge from the animal field, in particular in relation to novel regulators such as small, non-coding RNAs, epigenetic control and telomere length. Such a characterization of phenotypes via the acquisition of high-dimensional datasets within a systems biology approach will allow us to systematically characterize the various programmes governing senescence beyond leaf senescence in Arabidopsis and to elucidate the underlying molecular processes. Such a multi-omics approach is expected to also spur the application of results from model plants to agriculture and their verification for sustainable and environmentally friendly improvement of crop plant stress resilience and productivity and contribute to improvements based on postharvest physiology for the food industry and the benefit of its customers.},

The ability to create gene networks from experimental data and use them to reason about their dynamics and design principles will increase our understanding of cellular function. We propose that gene networks are also a good way to describe function unequivocally, and that they could be used for genome functional annotation.

On the basis of gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphism data in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we constructed gene regulatory networks using a two-stage penalized least squares method. A large system of structural equations via optimal prediction of a set of surrogate variables was established at the first stage, followed by consistent selection of regulatory effects at the second stage. Using this approach, we identified subnetworks that were enriched in gene ontology categories, revealing directional regulatory mechanisms controlling these biological pathways. Our mapping and analysis of expression-based quantitative trait loci uncovered a known alteration of gene expression within a biological pathway that results in regulatory effects on companion pathway genes in the phosphocholine network. In addition, we identify nodes in these gene ontology-enriched subnetworks that are coordinately controlled by transcription factors driven by trans-acting expression quantitative trait loci. Altogether, the integration of documented transcription factor regulatory associations with subnetworks defined by a system of structural equations using quantitative trait loci data is an effective means to delineate the transcriptional control of biological pathways.},

While inter-specific differences in hydraulic traits are widely documented, intra-specific hydraulic variability is less well known and is important for predicting climate change impacts. Here, I present a conceptual framework for this intra-specific hydraulic trait variability, reviewing the mechanisms that drive variability and the consequences for vegetation response to climate change. I performed a meta-analysis on published studies (n = 33) of intra-specific variation in a prominent hydraulic trait - water potential at which 50% stem conductivity is lost (P50) - and compared this variation to inter-specific variability within genera and plant functional types used by a dynamic global vegetation model. I found that intra-specific variability is of ecologically relevant magnitudes, equivalent to c. 33% of the inter-specific variability within a genus, and is larger in angiosperms than gymnosperms, although the limited number of studies highlights that more research is greatly needed. Furthermore, plant functional types were poorly situated to capture key differences in hydraulic traits across species, indicating a need to approach prediction of drought impacts from a trait-based, rather than functional type-based perspective.},

The ?lasso? minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

To explore the senescent cell proteome, we treated tumor cells with etoposide and enriched SA-β-GalHI cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The enriched TIS cells were compared to proliferating or quiescent cells by label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS proteomics and systems analysis, revealing activation of multiple lipid metabolism pathways. Senescent cells accumulated lipid droplets and imported lipid tracers, while treating proliferating cells with specific lipids induced senescence. Senescent cells also displayed increased lipid aldehydes and upregulation of aldehyde detoxifying enzymes. These results place deregulation of lipid metabolism alongside genotoxic stress as factors regulating cellular senescence.},

  abstract  = {During leaf senescence, macromolecule breakdown occurs and nutrients are translocated to support growth of new vegetative tissues, seeds, or other storage organs. In this study, we determined the fatty acid levels and profiles in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Brachypodium distachyon, and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) leaves during natural senescence. In young leaves, fatty acids represent 4% to 5% of dry weight and approximately 10% of the chemical energy content of the leaf tissues. In all three species, fatty acid levels in leaves began to decline at the onset of leaf senescence and progressively decreased as senescence advanced, resulting in a greater than 80% decline in fatty acids on a dry weight basis. During senescence, Arabidopsis leaves lost 1.6% of fatty acids per day at a rate of 2.1 mug per leaf (0.6 mug mg(-1) dry weight). Triacylglycerol levels remained less than 1% of total lipids at all stages. In contrast to glycerolipids, aliphatic surface waxes of Arabidopsis leaves were much more stable, showing only minor reduction during senescence. We also examined three Arabidopsis mutants, acx1acx2, lacs6lacs7, and kat2, which are blocked in enzyme activities of beta-oxidation and are defective in lipid mobilization during seed germination. In each case, no major differences in the fatty acid contents of leaves were observed between these mutants and the wild type, indicating that several mutations in beta-oxidation that cause reduced breakdown of reserve oil in seeds do not substantially reduce the degradation of fatty acids during leaf senescence.},

  abstract = {How do organisms, organs, tissues and cells change their fate when they age towards senescence and death? Plant leaves provide a unique window to explore this question because they show reproducible life history and are readily accessible for experimental assays. Throughout their lifespan, leaves undergo a series of developmental, physiological and metabolic transitions that culminate in senescence and death. Leaf senescence is an ‘altruistic death’ that allows for the degradation of the nutrients that are produced during the growth phase of the leaf and their redistribution to developing seeds or other parts of the plant, and thus is a strategy that has evolved to maximize the fitness of the plant. During the past decade, there has been significant progress towards understanding the key molecular principles of leaf senescence using genetic and molecular studies, as well as ‘omics’ analyses. It is now apparent that leaf senescence is a highly complex genetic program that is tightly controlled by multiple layers of regulation, including at the level of chromatin and transcription, as well as by post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation. This Commentary discusses the latest understandings and insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, and presents the perspectives necessary to enable our system-level understanding of leaf senescence, together with their possible implications for aging in general.},

Users can analyze public and user-specified data sets with minimal bioinformatics knowledge using the expVIP virtual machine. This generates a custom Web browser to visualize, sort, and filter the RNA-seq data and provides outputs for differential gene expression analysis. We demonstrate expVIP’s suitability for polyploid crops and evaluate its performance across a range of biologically relevant scenarios. To exemplify its use in crop research, we developed a flexible wheat (Triticum aestivum) expression browser (www.wheat-expression.com) that can be expanded with user-generated data in a local virtual machine environment. The open-access expVIP platform will facilitate the analysis of gene expression data from a wide variety of species by enabling the easy integration, visualization, and comparison of RNA-seq data across experiments.GlossaryRNA-seqtranscriptome sequencingSRAshort read archiveIWGSCInternational Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortiumtpmtranscripts per millionSNPsingle-nucleotide polymorphismqPCRquantitative PCRcDNAcomplementary DNAGOGene OntologyFDRfalse discovery rateNCBINational Center for Biotechnology Information},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The 6AL/6VS translocation lines, carrying the wheat powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21, are planted on more than 3.4 million hectares. The NAM-A1 gene, located on chromosome 6AS of hexaploid wheat, has been implicated with increased wheat grain protein content (GPC). However, the NAM-A1 gene was removed from the 6AL/6VS translocation lines after the original chromosome 6AS was replaced by chromosome 6VS of Haynaldia villosa. The present study aimed to clone the NAM homologous gene from chromosome 6VS, to analyze the changes of GPC in the 6AL/6VS translocation lines, and to develop related molecular markers for wheat molecular breeding. RESULTS: A new NAM family gene, NAM-V1, was cloned from 6VS of H. villosa (GenBank ACC. no. KR873101). NAM-V1 contained an intact open reading frame (ORF) and putatively encodes a protein of 407 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NAM-V1 was an orthologous gene of NAM-A1, B1, and D1. The determination of GPC in four Pm21 F2 segregation populations demonstrated that the replacement of NAM-A1 by NAM-V1 confers increased GPC in hexaploid wheat. Multiple sequence alignment of NAM-A1, B1, B2, D1, D2, and V1 showed the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites for each of the NAM genes, allowing us to develop a molecular marker, CauNAM-V1, for the specific detection of NAM-V1 gene. Our results indicate that CauNAM-V1 can be used as a novel DNA marker for NAM-V1, and can also be used for selecting Pm21 in wheat breeding programs. Further, we developed a marker, CauNAM-ABD, for the amplification and simultaneously distinguish among the NAM-A1, NAM-B1, NAM-B2, NAM-D1, and NAM-D2 genes in a single step. CauNAM-ABD enabled us to develop an efficient "one-marker-for-five-genes" procedure for identifying genes and its copy numbers related with grain protein content. CONCLUSION: Here, we report the isolation of the NAM-V1 gene of H. villosa. This gene contributes to increasing GPC in 6AL/6VS translocation wheat lines. We developed a molecular marker for the specific detection of NAM-V1 and a molecular marker that can be used to simultaneously distinguished among the NAM-A1, NAM-B1, NAM-B2, NAM-D1, and NAM-D2 genes in a single step.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The earliest visual changes of leaf senescence occur in the chloroplast as chlorophyll is degraded and photosynthesis declines. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the sequence of catabolic events occurring in chloroplasts during natural leaf senescence is still missing. Here, we combined confocal and electron microscopy together with proteomics and biochemistry to follow structural and molecular changes during Arabidopsis leaf senescence. We observed that initiation of chlorophyll catabolism precedes other breakdown processes. Chloroplast size, stacking of thylakoids, and efficiency of PSII remain stable until late stages of senescence, whereas the number and size of plastoglobules increase. Unlike catabolic enzymes, whose level increase, the level of most proteins decreases during senescence, and chloroplast proteins are overrepresented among these. However, the rate of their disappearance is variable, mostly uncoordinated and independent of their inherent stability during earlier developmental stages. Unexpectedly, degradation of chlorophyll-binding proteins lags behind chlorophyll catabolism. Autophagy and vacuole proteins are retained at relatively high levels, highlighting the role of extra-plastidic degradation processes especially in late stages of senescence. The observation that chlorophyll catabolism precedes all other catabolic events may suggest that this process enables or signals further catabolic processes in chloroplasts.},

However, strategies such as stimulation of root growth, increased transporter activities, and nutrient storage and remobilization have been mostly studied for only a few macronutrients. Leaves of cultivated crops (Zea mays, Brassica napus, Pisum sativum, Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare) and tree species (Quercus robur, Populus nigra, Alnus glutinosa) grown under field conditions were harvested regularly during their life span and analyzed to evaluate the net mobilization of 13 nutrients during leaf senescence. While N was remobilized in all plant species with different efficiencies ranging from 40% (maize) to 90% (wheat), other macronutrients (K-P-S-Mg) were mobilized in most species. Ca and Mn, usually considered as having low phloem mobility were remobilized from leaves in wheat and barley. Leaf content of Cu-Mo-Ni-B-Fe-Zn decreased in some species, as a result of remobilization. Overall, wheat, barley and oak appeared to be the most efficient at remobilization while poplar and maize were the least efficient. Further experiments were performed with rapeseed plants subjected to individual nutrient deficiencies. Compared to field conditions, remobilization from leaves was similar (N-S-Cu) or increased by nutrient deficiency (K-P-Mg) while nutrient deficiency had no effect on Mo-Zn-B-Ca-Mn, which seemed to be non-mobile during leaf senescence under field conditions. However, Ca and Mn were largely mobilized from roots (-97 and -86% of their initial root contents, respectively) to shoots. Differences in remobilization between species and between nutrients are then discussed in relation to a range of putative mechanisms.},

  abstract  = {As sessile organisms, plants have to continuously adjust growth and development to ever-changing environmental conditions. At the end of the growing season, annual plants induce leaf senescence to reallocate nutrients and energy-rich substances from the leaves to the maturing seeds. Thus, leaf senescence is a means with which to increase reproductive success and is therefore tightly coupled to the developmental age of the plant. However, senescence can also be induced in response to sub-optimal growth conditions as an exit strategy, which is accompanied by severely reduced yield. Here, we show that class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) transcription factors, which are known to be involved in basic pattern formation, have an additional role in controlling the onset of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. Several potential direct downstream genes of the HD-ZIPIII protein REVOLUTA (REV) have known roles in environment-controlled physiological processes. We report that REV acts as a redox-sensitive transcription factor, and directly and positively regulates the expression of WRKY53, a master regulator of age-induced leaf senescence. HD-ZIPIII proteins are required for the full induction of WRKY53 in response to oxidative stress, and mutations in HD-ZIPIII genes strongly delay the onset of senescence. Thus, a crosstalk between early and late stages of leaf development appears to contribute to reproductive success.},

  abstract = {The physiological process of how anthesis time and leaf senescence patterns affect individual grain weight of wheat has only been partially elucidated. In this study, a recombinant inbred line mapping population of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ‘Forno’) and its relative spelt (Triticum spelta L. ‘Oberkulmer’), contrasting for phasic development and leaf senescence kinetics, was used to understand the physiological and genetic relationships among anthesis time, leaf senescence, grain filling processes, and individual grain weight. Phenotypic measurements were taken in the field over two growing seasons. The results showed that earlier anthesis and delayed leaf senescence were associated with larger grains. Furthermore, early anthesis and delayed but fast leaf senescence promoted grain filling rate (but shortened its duration), grain water absorption rate and maximum grain water content, while individual grain dry matter and water accumulation displayed strong relationships with individual grain weight. A total of 118 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified in this mapping population, including six QTL for anthesis dates, 24 for flag leaf senescence, 69 for grain filling traits, and 19 for individual grain weight. Frequent QTL coincidences between these traits were observed on chromosomes 2A, 3B, 4A, 4DL, 5A, 5B, 5DL and 7B. Analysis of allelic effects confirmed the above physiological relationships. Therefore, anthesis time and leaf senescence affect individual grain weight at least partly through their effects on individual grain dry matter and water accumulation, resulting from pleiotropy or tight gene linkages. Slightly early anthesis, and delayed but fast leaf senescence, can be used to maximize individual grain weight and yield potential in wheat.},

Exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) can induce leaf senescence, whereas auxin suppresses this physiological process. Crosstalk between JA and auxin signaling has been well studied, but not during JA-induced leaf senescence. Here, we found that upon methyl jasmonate treatment, Arabidopsis thaliana wrky57 mutants produced typical leaf senescence symptoms, such as yellowing leaves, low chlorophyll content, and high cell death rates. Further investigation suggested that senescence-associated genes were upregulated in the wrky57 mutants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that WRKY57 directly binds to the promoters of SENESCENCE4 and SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE12 and represses their transcription. In vivo and in vitro experiments suggested that WRKY57 interacts with JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN4/8 (JAZ4/8) and the AUX/IAA protein IAA29, repressors of the JA and auxin signaling pathways, respectively. Consistent with the opposing functions of JA and auxin in JA-induced leaf senescence, JAZ4/8 and IAA29 also displayed opposite functions in JA-induced leaf senescence and competitively interacted with WRKY57. Our results suggested that the JA-induced leaf senescence process can be antagonized by auxin via WRKY57. Moreover, WRKY57 protein levels were downregulated by JA but upregulated by auxin. Therefore, as a repressor in JA-induced leaf senescence, WRKY57 is a common component of the JA- and auxin-mediated signaling pathways.GlossaryABAabscisic acidETethyleneJAjasmonic acidSAsalicylic acidMeJAmethyl jasmonateChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCaMVcauliflower mosaic virusBiFCbimolecular fluorescence complementationIAAindole-3-acetic acidCDScoding sequence},

Its tight regulation is essential for plant fitness and has crucial implications for the optimization of plant productivity and storage properties. Various investigations have shown light deprivation and light perception via phytochromes as key elements modulating senescence. However, the signalling pathways linking light deprivation and actual senescence processes have long remained obscure. Recent analyses have demonstrated that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are major transcription factors orchestrating dark-induced senescence (DIS) by targeting chloroplast maintenance, chlorophyll metabolism, hormone signalling and production, and the expression of senescence master regulators, uncovering potential molecular links to the energy deprivation signalling pathway. PIF-dependent feed-forward regulatory modules might be of critical importance for the highly complex and initially light-reversible DIS induction.},

  abstract  = {Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a commercially important crop, vulnerable to fungal disease red rot caused by Colletotrichum falcatum Went. The pathogen attacks sucrose accumulating parenchyma cells of cane stalk leading to severe losses in cane yield and sugar recovery. We report development of red rot resistant transgenic sugarcane through expression of β-1,3-glucanase gene from Trichoderma spp. The transgene integration and its expression were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in first clonal generation raised from T0 plants revealing up to 4.4-fold higher expression, in comparison to non-transgenic sugarcane. Bioassay of transgenic plants with two virulent C. falcatum pathotypes, Cf 08 and Cf 09 causing red rot disease demonstrated that some plants were resistant to Cf 08 and moderately resistant to Cf 09. The electron micrographs of sucrose storing stalk parenchyma cells from these plants displayed characteristic sucrose-filled cells inhibiting Cf 08 hyphae and lysis of Cf 09 hyphae; in contrast, the cells of susceptible plants were sucrose depleted and prone to both the pathotypes. The transgene expression was up-regulated (up to 2.0-fold in leaves and 5.0-fold in roots) after infection, as compared to before infection in resistant plants. The transgene was successfully transmitted to second clonal generation raised from resistant transgenic plants. β-1,3-glucanase protein structural model revealed that active sites Glutamate 628 and Aspartate 569 of the catalytic domain acted as proton donor and nucleophile having role in cleaving β-1,3-glycosidic bonds and pathogen hyphal lysis.},

  abstract  = {Author Summary Yellowing, caused by chlorophyll degradation, is the most obvious symptom of senescent leaves. Chlorophyll degradation can be triggered by a broad range of endogenous and environmental cues, and ethylene is one of the major inducers. Yet, the molecular regulation of chlorophyll degradation remains largely unknown. Here, we report a feed-forward regulation of ethylene-mediated chlorophyll degradation that involves ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), ORE1/NAC2, and major chlorophyll catabolic genes. EIN3, a master positive regulator of ethylene signaling, could directly promote chlorophyll degradation by physically binding to the promoters of three major chlorophyll catabolic genes to activate their expressions. Meanwhile, ORE1, a direct target of EIN3, also activates the expression of the similar set of chlorophyll catabolic genes directly. Moreover, ORE1 activates the expression of a major ethylene biosynthesis gene ACS2 during senescence, and subsequently activates a positive feedback to ethylene synthesis. Our work reveals a feed-forward loop that promotes ethylene-mediated chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence, advancing our understanding on the molecular mechanism of leaf yellowing.},

  abstract = {Global environmental changes caused by natural and human activities have accelerated in the past 200 years. The increase in greenhouse gases is predicted to continue to raise global temperature and change water availability in the 21(st) century. In this Review, we explore the profound effect the environment has on plant diseases - a susceptible host will not be infected by a virulent pathogen if the environmental conditions are not conducive for disease. The change in CO(2) concentrations, temperature, and water availability can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, as each disease may respond differently to these variations. However, the concept of disease optima could potentially apply to all pathosystems. Plant resistance pathways, including pattern-triggered immunity to effector-triggered immunity, RNA interference, and defense hormone networks, are all affected by environmental factors. On the pathogen side, virulence mechanisms, such as the production of toxins and virulence proteins, as well as pathogen reproduction and survival are influenced by temperature and humidity. For practical reasons, most laboratory investigations into plant-pathogen interactions at the molecular level focus on well-established pathosystems and use a few static environmental conditions that capture only a fraction of the dynamic plant-pathogen-environment interactions that occur in nature. There is great need for future research to increasingly use dynamic environmental conditions in order to fully understand the multidimensional nature of plant-pathogen interactions and produce disease-resistant crop plants that are resilient to climate change.},

  abstract = {Leaf senescence can be triggered and promoted by various environmental stressors, developmental cues, and endogenous hormone signals. Several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of WRKY transcription factors in regulating leaf senescence, but the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways involved remain elusive. In this study, we identified Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY DNA-binding protein 45 (WRKY45) as a positive regulator of age-triggered leaf senescence. Loss of WRKY45 function resulted in increased leaf longevity in age-triggered senescence, whereas overexpression of WRKY45 significantly accelerated age-triggered leaf senescence. Consistently, expression of SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENEs (SAGs) was significantly reduced in wrky45 mutants but markedly enhanced in transgenic plants overexpressing WRKY45. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that WRKY45 directly binds the promoters of several SAGs such as SAG12, SAG13, SAG113, and SEN4. Both in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrated that WRKY45 interacts with the DELLA protein RGA-LIKE1 (RGL1), a repressor of the gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway. We found that RGL1 repressed the transcription activation function of WRKY45, thereby attenuating the expression of its regulon. Consistent with this finding, overexpression of RGL1 resulted in significantly increased leaf longevity in age-triggered senescence. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that WRKY45 functions as a critical component of the GA-mediated signaling pathway to positively regulate age-triggered leaf senescence.},

  abstract  = {Leaf senescence is a highly coordinated, complicated process involving the integration of numerous internal and environmental signals. Salicylic acid (SA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two well-defined inducers of leaf senescence whose contents progressively and interdependently increase during leaf senescence via an unknown mechanism. Here, we characterized the transcription factor WRKY75 as a positive regulator of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockdown or knockout of WRKY75 delayed age-dependent leaf senescence, while overexpression of WRKY75 accelerated this process. WRKY75 transcription is induced by age, SA, H2O2, and multiple plant hormones. Meanwhile, WRKY75 promotes SA production by inducing the transcription of SA INDUCTION-DEFICIENT2 (SID2) and suppresses H2O2 scavenging, partly by repressing the transcription of CATALASE2 (CAT2). Genetic analysis revealed that the mutation of SID2 or an increase in catalase activity rescued the precocious leaf senescence phenotype evoked by WRKY75 overexpression. Based on these results, we propose a tripartite amplification loop model in which WRKY75, SA, and ROS undergo a gradual but self-sustained rise driven by three interlinking positive feedback loops. This tripartite amplification loop provides a molecular framework connecting upstream signals, such as age and plant hormones, to the downstream regulatory network executed by SA- and H2O2-responsive transcription factors during leaf senescence.},

  abstract = {Climate change is impacting food and beverage crops around the world with implications for environmental and human well-being. While numerous studies have examined climate change effects on crop yields, relatively few studies have examined effects on crop quality (concentrations of nutrients, minerals, and secondary metabolites). This review article employs a culturally relevant beverage crop, tea (Camelia sinensis), as a lens to examine environmental effects linked to climate change on the directionality of crop quality. Our systematic review identified 86 articles as relevant to the review question. Findings provide evidence that shifts in seasonality, water stress, geography, light factors, altitude, herbivory and microbes, temperature, and soil factors that are linked to climate change can result in both increases and decreases up to 50% in secondary metabolites. A gap was found regarding evidence on the direct effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, highlighting a critical research area for future study. While this systematic review provides evidence that multiple environmental parameters are impacting tea quality, the directionality and magnitude of these impacts is not clear with contradictory evidence between studies likely due to confounding factors including variation in tea variety, cultivar, specific environmental and agricultural management conditions, and differences in research methods. The environmental factors with the most consistent evidence in this systematic review were seasonality and water stress with 14 out of 18 studies (78%) demonstrating a decrease in concentrations of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with a seasonal shift from the spring and /or first tea harvest to other seasons and seven out of 10 studies (70%) showing an increase in levels of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with drought stress. Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence on tea quality. Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. The development of evidence-based management strategies and crop breeding programs for resilient cultivars are called for to mitigate climate impacts on crop quality and overall risk in agricultural and food systems.},

  abstract     = {Wheat is one of the major sources of food for much of the world. However, because bread wheat{\textquoteright}s genome is a large hybrid mix of three separate subgenomes, it has been difficult to produce a high-quality reference sequence. Using recent advances in sequencing, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium presents an annotated reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among subgenomes and the structural organization for all the chromosomes. Examples of quantitative trait mapping and CRISPR-based genome modification show the potential for using this genome in agricultural research and breeding. Ram{\'\i}rez-Gonz{\'a}lez et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat.Science, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089INTRODUCTIONWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely cultivated crop on Earth, contributing about a fifth of the total calories consumed by humans. Consequently, wheat yields and production affect the global economy, and failed harvests can lead to social unrest. Breeders continuously strive to develop improved varieties by fine-tuning genetically complex yield and end-use quality parameters while maintaining stable yields and adapting the crop to regionally specific biotic and abiotic stresses.RATIONALEBreeding efforts are limited by insufficient knowledge and understanding of wheat biology and the molecular basis of central agronomic traits. To meet the demands of human population growth, there is an urgent need for wheat research and breeding to accelerate genetic gain as well as to increase and protect wheat yield and quality traits. In other plant and animal species, access to a fully annotated and ordered genome sequence, including regulatory sequences and genome-diversity information, has promoted the development of systematic and more time-efficient approaches for the selection and understanding of important traits. Wheat has lagged behind, primarily owing to the challenges of assembling a genome that is more than five times as large as the human genome, polyploid, and complex, containing more than 85\% repetitive DNA. To provide a foundation for improvement through molecular breeding, in 2005, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium set out to deliver a high-quality annotated reference genome sequence of bread wheat.RESULTSAn annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in the form of 21 chromosome-like sequence assemblies has now been delivered, giving access to 107,891 high-confidence genes, including their genomic context of regulatory sequences. This assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage{\textendash}related gene coexpression networks using a transcriptome atlas representing all stages of wheat development. The dynamics of change in complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. Aspects of the future value of the annotated assembly for molecular breeding and research were exemplarily illustrated by resolving the genetic basis of a quantitative trait locus conferring resistance to abiotic stress and insect damage as well as by serving as the basis for genome editing of the flowering-time trait.CONCLUSIONThis annotated reference sequence of wheat is a resource that can now drive disruptive innovation in wheat improvement, as this community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding. Importantly, the bioinformatics capacity developed for model-organism genomes will facilitate a better understanding of the wheat genome as a result of the high-quality chromosome-based genome assembly. By necessity, breeders work with the genome at the whole chromosome level, as each new cross involves the modification of genome-wide gene networks that control the expression of complex traits such as yield. With the annotated and ordered reference genome sequence in place, researchers and breeders can now easily access sequence-level information to precisely define the necessary changes in the genomes for breeding programs. This will be realized through the implementation of new DNA marker platforms and targeted breeding technologies, including genome editing.Wheat genome deciphered, assembled, and ordered.Seeds, or grains, are what counts with respect to wheat yields (left panel), but all parts of the plant contribute to crop performance. With complete access to the ordered sequence of all 21 wheat chromosomes, the context of regulatory sequences, and the interaction network of expressed genes{\textemdash}all shown here as a circular plot (right panel) with concentric tracks for diverse aspects of wheat genome composition{\textemdash}breeders and researchers now have the ability to rewrite the story of wheat crop improvement. Details on value ranges underlying the concentric heatmaps of the right panel are provided in the full article online.An annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in 21 pseudomolecules has been analyzed to identify the distribution and genomic context of coding and noncoding elements across the A, B, and D subgenomes. With an estimated coverage of 94\% of the genome and containing 107,891 high-confidence gene models, this assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage{\textendash}related coexpression networks by providing a transcriptome atlas representing major stages of wheat development. Dynamics of complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci.

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Short-read sequencing technologies have made microbial genome sequencing cheap and accessible. However, closing genomes is often costly and assembling short reads from genomes that are repetitive and/or have extreme %GC content remains challenging. Long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION have the potential to overcome these difficulties, although the best approach for harnessing their potential remains poorly evaluated. RESULTS: We sequenced nine bacterial genomes spanning a wide range of GC contents using Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technologies to determine the advantages of each approach, both individually and combined. Assemblies using only MiSeq reads were highly accurate but lacked contiguity, a deficiency that was partially overcome by adding MinION reads to these assemblies. Even more contiguous genome assemblies were generated by using MinION reads for initial assembly, but these assemblies were more error-prone and required further polishing. This was especially pronounced when Illumina libraries were biased, as was the case for our strains with both high and low GC content. Increased genome contiguity dramatically improved the annotation of insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, likely because long-reads can disambiguate these highly repetitive but biologically important genomic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Genome assembly using short-reads is challenged by repetitive sequences and extreme GC contents. Our results indicate that these difficulties can be largely overcome by using single-molecule, long-read sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION. Using MinION reads for assembly followed by polishing with Illumina reads generated the most contiguous genomes with sufficient accuracy to enable the accurate annotation of important but difficult to sequence genomic features such as insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. The combination of Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing can therefore cost-effectively advance studies of microbial evolution and genome-driven drug discovery.},

  abstract               = {In this case study we successfully teamed the PDQeX DNA purification technology developed by MicroGEM, New Zealand, with the MinION and MinIT mobile sequencing devices developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies to produce an effective point-of-need field diagnostic system. The PDQeX extracts DNA using a cocktail of thermophilic proteinases and cell wall-degrading enzymes, thermo-responsive extractor cartridges and a temperature control unit. This closed system delivers purified DNA with no cross-contamination. The MinIT is a newly released data processing unit that converts MinION raw signal output into nucleotide base called data locally in real-time, removing the need for high-specification computers and large file transfers from the field. All three devices are battery powered with an exceptionally small footprint that facilitates transport and setup. To evaluate and validate capability of the system for unbiased pathogen identification by real-time sequencing in a farmer's field setting, we analysed samples collected from cassava plants grown by subsistence farmers in three sub-Sahara African countries (Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya). A range of viral pathogens, all with similar symptoms, greatly reduce yield or destroy cassava crops. Eight hundred (800) million people worldwide depend on cassava for food and yearly income, and viral diseases are a significant constraint to its production. Early pathogen detection at a molecular level has great potential to rescue crops within a single growing season by providing results that inform decisions on disease management, use of appropriate virus-resistant or replacement planting. This case study presented conditions of working in-field with limited or no access to mains power, laboratory infrastructure, Internet connectivity and highly variable ambient temperature. An additional challenge is that, generally, plant material contains inhibitors of downstream molecular processes making effective DNA purification critical. We successfully undertook real-time on-farm genome sequencing of samples collected from cassava plants on three farms, one in each country. Cassava mosaic begomoviruses were detected by sequencing leaf, stem, tuber and insect samples. The entire process, from arrival on farm to diagnosis, including sample collection, processing and provisional sequencing results was complete in under 3 h. The need for accurate, rapid and on-site diagnosis grows as globalized human activity accelerates. This technical breakthrough has applications that are relevant to human and animal health, environmental management and conservation.},

SK-means is particularly useful when the dataset has a large fraction of noise variables (that is, variables without useful information to separate the clusters). SK-means works very well on clean and complete data but cannot handle outliers nor missing data. To remedy these problems we introduce a new robust and sparse K-means clustering algorithm implemented in the R package RSKC. We demonstrate the use of our package on four datasets. We also conduct a Monte Carlo study to compare the performances of RSK-means and SK-means regarding the selection of important variables and identification of clusters. Our simulation study shows that RSK-means performs well on clean data and better than SK-means and other competitors on outlier-contaminated data.},

  abstract  = {This paper offers an overview of how climate change is already affecting farmers across eastern and southern Africa, and how it will continue to affect them in the future. The rising temperatures and increased rainfall variability associated with climate change are undermining the livelihoods and food security of Africa's farmers, most of whom work at a subsistence level and also face problems of poverty, inadequate infrastructure and poor governance. To address these problems, governments and development organizations have promoted climate-smart agriculture (CSA). These projects, however, have been constrained by inadequate data and predictions regarding future climate change. In particular, farmers in Africa need better projections of the climate hazards for specific regions. Historical weather data at the local level contains many gaps, and the continuing collection of such data could be much improved. Strengthening the database of observed weather is critical to understanding the changes that have occurred already, to project future changes, and to plan appropriately to address them. Once collected and analyzed, climate data must be communicated in ways that help decision-makers understand climate impacts. Good tools are available---such as ClimateWizard.org and Servir ClimateServ---but practitioners at the local level must have the access and training to use them. Even in places where projections are uncertain, steps can be taken now to implement CSA practices and make farmers more resilient in the face of climate change.},

Using quantile regression analyses, we show that the impact of precipitation deficits on the number of hot days is asymmetric, i.e. extreme high numbers of hot days are most strongly influenced. This relationship also applies to the 2011 extreme event in Texas. These findings suggest that effects of soil moisture-temperature coupling are geographically more widespread than commonly assumed.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Spring wheat is the largest agricultural crop grown in Kazakhstan with an annual sowing area of 12 million hectares in 2016. Annually, the country harvests around 15 million tons of high quality grain. Despite environmental stress factors it is predicted that the use of new technologies may lead to increases in productivity from current levels of 1.5 to up to 3 tons per hectare. One way of improving wheat productivity is by the application of new genomic oriented approaches in plant breeding projects. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are emerging as powerful tools for the understanding of the inheritance of complex traits via utilization of high throughput genotyping technologies and phenotypic assessments of plant collections. In this study, phenotyping and genotyping data on 194 spring wheat accessions from Kazakhstan, Russia, Europe, and CIMMYT were assessed for the identification of marker-trait associations (MTA) of agronomic traits by using GWAS. RESULTS: Field trials in Northern, Central and Southern regions of Kazakhstan using 194 spring wheat accessions revealed strong correlations of yield with booting date, plant height, biomass, number of spikes per plant, and number of kernels per spike. The accessions from Europe and CIMMYT showed high breeding potential for Southern and Central regions of the country in comparison with the performance of the local varieties. The GGE biplot method, using average yield per plant, suggested a clear separation of accessions into their three breeding origins in relationship to the three environments in which they were evaluated. The genetic variation in the three groups of accessions was further studied using 3245 polymorphic SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers. The application of Principal Coordinate analysis clearly grouped the 194 accessions into three clades according to their breeding origins. GWAS on data from nine field trials allowed the identification of 114 MTAs for 12 different agronomic traits. CONCLUSIONS: Field evaluation of foreign germplasm revealed its poor yield performance in Northern Kazakhstan, which is the main wheat growing region in the country. However, it was found that EU and CIMMYT germplasm has high breeding potential to improve yield performance in Central and Southern regions. The use of Principal Coordinate analysis clearly separated the panel into three distinct groups according to their breeding origin. GWAS based on use of the TASSEL 5.0 package allowed the identification of 114 MTAs for twelve agronomic traits. The study identifies a network of key genes for improvement of yield productivity in wheat growing regions of Kazakhstan.},

  abstract               = {Auxin regulates a variety of physiological and developmental processes in plants. Although auxin acts as a suppressor of leaf senescence, its exact role in this respect has not been clearly defined, aside from circumstantial evidence. It was found here that ARF2 functions in the auxin-mediated control of Arabidopsis leaf longevity, as discovered by screening EMS mutant pools for a delayed leaf senescence phenotype. Two allelic mutations, ore14-1 and 14-2, caused a highly significant delay in all senescence parameters examined, including chlorophyll content, the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, membrane ion leakage, and the expression of senescence-associated genes. A delay of senescence symptoms was also observed under various senescence-accelerating conditions, where detached leaves were treated with darkness, phytohormones, or oxidative stress. These results indicate that the gene defined by these mutations might be a key regulatory genetic component controlling functional leaf senescence. Map-based cloning of ORE14 revealed that it encodes ARF2, a member of the auxin response factor (ARF) protein family, which modulates early auxin-induced gene expression in plants. The ore14/arf2 mutation also conferred an increased sensitivity to exogenous auxin in hypocotyl growth inhibition, thereby demonstrating that ARF2 is a repressor of auxin signalling. Therefore, the ore14/arf2 lesion appears to cause reduced repression of auxin signalling with increased auxin sensitivity, leading to delayed senescence. Altogether, our data suggest that ARF2 positively regulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis.},

  abstract  = {Plant defense responses are tightly controlled by many positive and negative regulators to cope with attacks from various pathogens. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE2 (EDR2) is a negative regulator of powdery mildew resistance, and edr2 mutants display enhanced resistance to powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum). To identify components acting in the EDR2 pathway, we screened for edr2 suppressors and identified a gain-of-function mutation in SIGNAL RESPONSIVE1 (SR1), which encodes a calmodulin-binding transcription activator. The sr1-4D gain-of-function mutation suppresses all edr2-associated phenotypes, including powdery mildew resistance, mildew-induced cell death, and ethylene-induced senescence. The sr1-4D single mutant is more susceptible to a Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 virulent strain and to avirulent strains carrying avrRpt2 or avrRPS4 than the wild type. We show that SR1 directly binds to the promoter region of NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (NDR1), a key component in RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE2-mediated plant immunity. Also, the ndr1 mutation suppresses the sr1-1 null allele, which shows enhanced resistance to both P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 avrRpt2 and G. cichoracearum. In addition, we show that SR1 regulates ethylene-induced senescence by directly binding to the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) promoter region in vivo. Enhanced ethylene-induced senescence in sr1-1 is suppressed by ein3. Our data indicate that SR1 plays an important role in plant immunity and ethylene signaling by directly regulating NDR1 and EIN3.},

  abstract = {Synchronisation of flowering phenology has often been observed between individuals within plant species. We expected that a critical role of flowering-time control under natural conditions is a phenological synchronisation. However, no studies have quantified the level of synchronisation of reproductive timing relative to germination timing under natural conditions. In a sequential seeding experiment (SSE) in which we manipulated the germination timing of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, we developed a quantification index to evaluate reproductive synchrony in annual plants. In the SSE, we identified a novel phenomenon of reproductive synchrony: senescence synchrony. The role of vernalisation in realising flowering synchrony between plants of different ages under natural conditions was demonstrated by synchronisation and de-synchronisation of flowering initiation in vernalisation-sensitive and less-vernalisation-sensitive accessions, respectively. We also observed up-regulation of senescence-related genes at corresponding times. The approach we developed in this study provides a set of concepts and procedures that can be used to study reproductive synchrony experimentally under natural conditions.},

  abstract  = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine the dynamics of gene expression. Interest often focuses on the topological structure of a GRN while numerical parameters (e.g. decay rates) are unknown and less important. For larger GRNs, inference of structure from gene expression data is prohibitively difficult. Models are often proposed based on integrative interpretation of multiple sources of information. We have developed DoGeNetS (Discrimination of Gene Network Structures), a method to directly assess candidate models of GRN structure against a target gene expression data set. The transsys language serves to model GRN structures. Numeric parameters are optimised to approximate the target data. Multiple restarts of optimisation yield score sets that provide a basis to statistically discriminate candidate models according to their potential to explain the target data. We demonstrate discrimination power of the DoGeNetS method by relating structural divergence to divergence between gene expression data sets. Known models are used to generate target expression data, and a set of candidate models with a defined structural divergence to the true model is produced. Structural divergence and divergence of expression profiles after optimisation are strongly correlated. We further show that discrimination is possible at noise levels exceeding those typical of contemporary microarray data. DoGeNetS is capable of discriminating the best GRN structure from among a small number of candidates. p values indicate whether differences in divergence of expression are significant. Although this study uses single gene knockouts, the DoGeNetS method can be adapted to simulate a virtually unlimited range of experimental conditions. [Includes supplementary material]},

  abstract = { The degree to which the genotype of an organism can affect the composition of its associated microbial communities (“microbiome”) varies by organism and habitat, and in many cases is unknown. We analyzed the metabolically active bacteria of maize leaves across 300 diverse maize lines growing in a common environment. We performed comprehensive heritability analysis for 49 community diversity metrics, 380 bacterial clades, and 9,042 predicted metagenomic functions. We find that only a few bacterial clades (5) and diversity metrics (2) are significantly heritable, while a much larger number of metabolic functions (200) are. Many of these associations appear to be driven by the Methylobacteria in each sample. Among these heritable metabolic traits, Fisher’s exact test identifies significant overrepresentation of traits relating to short-chain carbon metabolism, secretion, and nitrotoluene degradation. Genome-wide association analysis identified a small number of associated loci for these heritable traits, including two that affect multiple traits. Our results indicate that while most of the maize leaf microbiome composition is driven by environmental factors and/or stochastic founder events, a subset of bacterial taxa and metabolic functions is nonetheless significantly impacted by host genetics. Additional work will be needed to identify the exact nature of these interactions and what effects they may have on their host. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Exotic germplasm possesses high levels of genetic diversity for valuable traits. However, only a small fraction of naturally occurring genetic diversity is utilized. Moreover, the yield gap between elite and exotic germplasm widens, which increases the effort needed to use exotic germplasm and to identify beneficial alleles and for their introgression. The advent of high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping technologies together with emerging biotechnologies provide new opportunities to explore exotic genetic variation.

  abstract  = {Fusarium head blight (FHB),is a devastating disease of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), causing reductions in yield and quality. Marker-based selection for resistance to FHB and lowered deoxynivalenol (DON) grain concentration would save considerable costs and time associated with phenotyping. A marker-based selection approach called genomic selection (GS) uses genomewide marker information to predict genetic value. We used a cross-validation approach that separated training sets from validation sets by both entry and environment. We used this framework to test the potential of GS for genetic improvement of FHB and DON as well as test the effect of different factors on prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy for FHB was found to be as high as 0.72 and that for DON was found to be as high as 0.68. Little difference was found between marker effect estimation methods in terms of prediction of entry genetic value. The extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) present in this population allowed the marker set to be reduced to 384 markers and training population (TP) size to be reduced 200 with little effect on prediction accuracy. We found little to no advantage to combining subpopulations that correspond to neighboring breeding programs to increase TP size. Apparently, little genetic information is shared between subpopulations, either because of different marker-quantitative trait loci (QTL) linkage phases, different segregating QTL, or nonadditive gene action.},

  abstract               = {Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has long been associated with the production and export of a diverse range of agricultural commodities. Due to its strategic geographic location, which encompasses a wide range of climates, it is possible to produce almost any crop. The climate diversity in LAC is a major factor in its agricultural potential but this also means climate change represents a real threat to the region. Therefore, LAC farming must prepare and quickly adapt to an environment that is likely to feature long periods of drought, excessive rainfall and extreme temperatures. With the aim of moving toward a more resilient agriculture, LAC scientists have created the Latin American Plant Phenomics Network (LatPPN) which focuses on LAC's economically important crops. LatPPN's key strategies to achieve its main goal are: (1) training of LAC members on plant phenomics and phenotyping, (2) establish international and multidisciplinary collaborations, (3) develop standards for data exchange and research protocols, (4) share equipment and infrastructure, (5) disseminate data and research results, (6) identify funding opportunities and (7) develop strategies to guarantee LatPPN's relevance and sustainability across time. Despite the challenges ahead, LatPPN represents a big step forward toward the consolidation of a common mind-set in the field of plant phenotyping and phenomics in LAC.},

Here, we combine the mapping power and precision of a MAGIC wheat population with robust computational methods to track the spatio- temporal dynamics of traits associated with wheat performance. NIAB MAGIC lines were phenotyped throughout their lifecycle under smart house conditions. Growth models were fitted to the data describing growth trajectories of plant area, height, water use and senescence and fitted parameters were mapped as quantitative traits. Trait data from single time points were also mapped to determine when and how markers became and ceased to be significant. Assessment of temporal dynamics allowed the identification of marker-trait associations and tracking of trait development against the genetic contribution of key markers. We establish a data-driven approach for understanding complex agronomic traits and accelerate research in plant breeding.},

Innovative technologies are needed to design strategies that will achieve higher crop yields on less land and with fewer resources. Computational modeling coupled with advanced scientific visualization enables researchers to explore and interact with complex agriculture, nutrition, and climate data to predict how crops will respond to untested environments. These virtual observations and predictions can direct the development of crop ideotypes designed to meet future yield and nutritional demands. This review surveys modeling strategies for the development of crop ideotypes and scientific visualization technologies that have led to discoveries in "big data" analysis. Combined modeling and visualization approaches have been used to realistically simulate crops and to guide selection that immediately enhances crop quantity and quality under challenging environmental conditions. This survey of current and developing technologies indicates that integrative modeling and advanced scientific visualization may help overcome challenges in agriculture and nutrition data as large-scale and multidimensional data become available in these fields.},

  abstract               = {The purple kale (Brassica Oleracea var. acephala f. tricolor) is a mutation in kales, giving the mutant phenotype of brilliant purple color in the interior. Total anthocyanin analysis showed that the amount of anthocyanins in the purple kale was up to 1.73 mg g(-1) while no anthocyanin was detected in the white kale. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the anthocyanin biosynthesis in the purple kale, we analyzed the expression of structural genes and some transcription factors associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis in the purple cultivar "Red Dove" and the white cultivar "White Dove". The result showed that nearly all the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes showed higher expression levels in the purple cultivar than in the white cultivar, especially for DFR and ANS, they were barely detected in the white cultivar. Interestingly, the fact that a R2R3 MYB transcription factor named BoPAP1 was extremely up-regulated in the purple kale and induced by low temperature attracted our attention. Further sequence analysis showed that BoPAP1 shared high similarity with AtPAP1 and BoMYB1. In addition, the anthocyanin accumulation in the purple kale is strongly induced by the low temperature stress. The total anthocyanin contents in the purple kale under low temperature were about 50-fold higher than the plants grown in the greenhouse. The expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes C4H, F3H, DFR, ANS and UFGT were all enhanced under the low temperature. These evidences strongly suggest that BoPAP1 may play an important role in activating the anthocyanin structural genes for the abundant anthocyanin accumulation in the purple kale.},

  abstract           = {The plant hormone ethylene affects myriad developmental processes ranging from seed germination to organ senescence, and plays a crucial role in plant resistance to environmental stresses. The C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factor genes (CBF1-3) are transcriptional activators involved in plant low-temperatures responses; their overexpression enhances frost tolerance, but also has various pleiotropic effects on growth and development, mainly growth retardation and delay of flowering and senescence. We found that overexpression of CBF2 in Arabidopsis suppressed leaf tissue responsiveness to ethylene as compared with wild-type plants, as manifested in significantly delayed senescence and chlorophyll degradation. In wild-type plants, exposure to ethylene at 0.1 microl.l(-1) for 48 h caused 50% reduction in chlorophyll levels as compared to leaves held in air alone, whereas CBF2-overexpressing plants required an ethylene concentration of 10.0 microl.l(-1) to cause the same effect. Furthermore, continuous exposure to ethylene at 1.0 microl.l(-1) reduced chlorophyll content in wild-type leaves by 50% after 42 h but took 72 h in CBF2-overexpressing plants. Transcript profiling of ethylene receptors and signal transduction genes in leaves of wild-type and CBF2-overexpressing plants, by means of the Affymetrix ATH1 genome array, revealed only minor differences in gene expression patterns - insufficient to explain the observed responsiveness differences. Nevertheless, we found that overexpression of CBF2 significantly increased transcript levels of 17 ABA biosynthetic and responsive genes and, thus, may have affected leaf responsiveness to ethylene via contrasting interactions with other hormones, mainly ABA. Overall, the current findings suggest that overexpression of the CBF2 transcriptional activator in Arabidopsis may, at least in part, contribute to the observed delay of leaf senescence and enhanced plant fitness by suppressing leaf responsiveness to stress-regulated ethylene.},

Drought-induced leaf senescence is an intricate process with remarkably coordinated phases of onset, progression, and completion implicated in an extensive reprogramming of gene expression. Advancing leaf senescence remobilizes nutrients to younger leaves thereby contributing to plant fitness. However, numerous mysteries remain unraveled concerning leaf senescence. We are not still able to correlate leaf senescence and drought stress to endogenous and exogenous environments. Furthermore, we need to decipher how molecular mechanisms of the leaf senescence and levels of drought tolerance are advanced and how is the involvement of SAGs in drought tolerance and plant fitness. This review provides the perspicacity indispensable for facilitating our coordinated point of view pertaining to leaf senescence together with inferences on progression of whole plant aging. The main segments discussed in the review include coordination between hormonal signaling, leaf senescence, drought tolerance, and crosstalk between hormones in leaf senescence regulation.},

However, the role of ELF3 in stress responses remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that ELF3 enhances plants' resilience to salt stress: ELF3-overexpressing (ELF3-OX) plants are salt-tolerant, while elf3 mutants are more sensitive to salt stress. The expressions of many salt stress- and senescence-associated genes are altered in elf3-1 and ELF3-OX plants compared with wild-type. During salt stress, ELF3 suppresses factors that promote salt stress response pathways, mainly GIGANTEA (GI), at the post-translational level, and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4), at the transcriptional level. To enhance the salt stress response, PIF4 directly downregulates the transcription of JUNGBRUNNEN1 (JUB1/ANAC042), encoding a transcription factor that upregulates the expression of stress tolerance genes, DREB2A and DELLA. Furthermore, PIF4 directly upregulates the transcription of ORESARA1 (ORE1/ANAC092) and SAG29, positive regulators of salt stress response pathways. Based on our results, we propose that ELF3 modulates key regulatory components in salt stress response pathways at the transcriptional and post-translational levels.},

However, our knowledge of the regulatory pathways by which shade and darkness induce leaf senescence remains incomplete. To determine to what extent reduced light intensities regulate the induction of leaf senescence, we performed a functional comparison between Arabidopsis leaves subjected to a range of shading treatments. Individually covered leaves, which remained attached to the plant, were compared with respect to chlorophyll, protein, histology, expression of senescence-associated genes, capacity for photosynthesis and respiration, and light compensation point (LCP). Mild shading induced photosynthetic acclimation and resource partitioning, which, together with a decreased respiration, lowered the LCP. Leaf senescence was induced only under strong shade, coinciding with a negative carbon balance and independent of the red/far-red ratio. Interestingly, while senescence was significantly delayed at very low light compared with darkness, phytochrome A mutant plants showed enhanced chlorophyll degradation under all shading treatments except complete darkness. Taken together, our results suggest that the induction of leaf senescence during shading depends on the efficiency of carbon fixation, which in turn appears to be modulated via light receptors such as phytochrome A.},

For leaves, evidence supports a role of sugar accumulation in the initiation and/or acceleration of senescence. However, regulation of senescence or ageing may respond to different metabolic signals in heterotrophic plant organs and heterotrophic organisms. In animals and yeast, dietary restriction results in increased lifespan. In this article, the metabolic regulation of leaf senescence is compared with the effects of dietary restriction. Similarities and differences in the signalling pathways are discussed, including the role of autophagy, TOR (target of rapamycin), Sir2 (silent information regulator-2), and SnRK1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1).},

A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because they provide a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate this method on the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al. (1998).},

  abstract  = {MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference based on genomic data is one of the most actively pursued computational biological problems. Because different types of biological data usually provide complementary information regarding the underlying GRN, a model that integrates big data of diverse types is expected to increase both the power and accuracy of GRN inference. Towards this goal, we propose a novel algorithm named iRafNet: integrative random forest for gene regulatory network inference. RESULTS: iRafNet is a flexible, unified integrative framework that allows information from heterogeneous data, such as protein-protein interactions, transcription factor (TF)-DNA-binding, gene knock-down, to be jointly considered for GRN inference. Using test data from the DREAM4 and DREAM5 challenges, we demonstrate that iRafNet outperforms the original random forest based network inference algorithm (GENIE3), and is highly comparable to the community learning approach. We apply iRafNet to construct GRN in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that it improves the performance in predicting TF-target gene regulations and provides additional functional insights to the predicted gene regulations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R code of iRafNet implementation and a tutorial are available at: http://research.mssm.edu/tulab/software/irafnet.html},

Senescence is not observed in young leaves, indicating that repressors efficiently act to suppress cell degradation during early leaf development and/or that senescence activators are switched on when a leaf ages. Thus, massive regulatory network re-wiring likely constitutes an important component of the pre-senescence process. Transcription factors (TFs) have been shown to be central elements of such regulatory networks. Here, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis to study the expression of 1880 TF genes during pre-senescence and early-senescence stages of leaf development, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. We show that the expression of 185 TF genes changes when leaves develop from half to fully expanded leaves and finally enter partial senescence. Our analysis identified 41 TF genes that were gradually up-regulated as leaves progressed through these developmental stages. We also identified 144 TF genes that were down-regulated during senescence. A considerable number of the senescence-regulated TF genes were found to respond to abiotic stress, and salt stress appeared to be the major factor controlling their expression. Our data indicate a peculiar fine-tuning of developmental shifts during late-leaf development that is controlled by TFs.},

However, the function of most of SAGs in regulating leaf senescence as well as regulators of those functionally known SAGs are still unclear. We have previously developed a curated database of genes potentially associated with leaf senescence, the Leaf Senescence Database (LSD). In this study, we built gene networks to identify common regulators of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana using promoting or delaying senescence genes in LSD. Our results demonstrated that plant hormones cytokinin, auxin, nitric oxide as well as small molecules, such as Ca2+, delay leaf senescence. By contrast, ethylene, ABA, SA and JA as well as small molecules, such as oxygen, promote leaf senescence, altogether supporting the idea that phytohormones play a critical role in regulating leaf senescence. Functional analysis of candidate SAGs in LSD revealed that a WRKY transcription factor WRKY75 and a Cys2/His2?type transcription factor AZF2 are positive regulators of leaf senescence and loss-of-function of WRKY75 or AZF2 delayed leaf senescence. We also found that silencing of a protein phosphatase, AtMKP2, promoted early senescence. Collectively, LSD can serve as a comprehensive resource for systematic study of the molecular mechanism of leaf senescence as well as offer candidate genes for functional analyses.},

  abstract  = {Leaf senescence is an essential developmental process that impacts dramatically on crop yields and involves altered regulation of thousands of genes and many metabolic and signaling pathways, resulting in major changes in the leaf. The regulation of senescence is complex, and although senescence regulatory genes have been characterized, there is little information on how these function in the global control of the process. We used microarray analysis to obtain a high-resolution time-course profile of gene expression during development of a single leaf over a 3-week period to senescence. A complex experimental design approach and a combination of methods were used to extract high-quality replicated data and to identify differentially expressed genes. The multiple time points enable the use of highly informative clustering to reveal distinct time points at which signaling and metabolic pathways change. Analysis of motif enrichment, as well as comparison of transcription factor (TF) families showing altered expression over the time course, identify clear groups of TFs active at different stages of leaf development and senescence. These data enable connection of metabolic processes, signaling pathways, and specific TF activity, which will underpin the development of network models to elucidate the process of senescence.},

By analysing microarray expression data from 27 different treatments (that are known to promote senescence) and comparing them with that from developmental leaf senescence, we were able to show that at early stages of treatments, different hormones and stresses showed limited similarity in the induction of gene expression to that of developmental leaf senescence. Once the senescence process is initiated, as evidenced by visible yellowing, generally after a prolonged period of treatments, a great proportion of SAGs of developmental leaf senescence are shared by gene expression profiles in response to different treatments. This indicates that although different signals that lead to initiation of senescence may do so through distinct signal transduction pathways, senescence processes induced either developmentally or by different senescence-promoting treatments may share common execution events.},

We use rxncon, the reaction-contingency language, to neutralise the scalability issues preventing formulation, visualisation and simulation of signalling networks at the genome-scale. We use parameter-free modelling to validate the network and to predict genotype-to-phenotype relationships down to residue resolution. This mechanistic genome-scale model offers a new perspective on eukaryotic cell cycle control, and opens up for similar models-and eventually whole-cell models-of human cells.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: The ability of grass species to adapt to various habitats is attributed to the dynamic nature of their genomes, which have been shaped by multiple rounds of ancient and recent polyploidization. To gain a better understanding of the nature and extent of variation in functionally relevant regions of a polyploid genome, we developed a sequence capture assay to compare exonic sequences of allotetraploid wheat accessions. RESULTS: A sequence capture assay was designed for the targeted re-sequencing of 3.5 Mb exon regions that surveyed a total of 3,497 genes from allotetraploid wheat. These data were used to describe SNPs, copy number variation and homoeologous sequence divergence in coding regions. A procedure for variant discovery in the polyploid genome was developed and experimentally validated. About 1% and 24% of discovered SNPs were loss-of-function and non-synonymous mutations, respectively. Under-representation of replacement mutations was identified in several groups of genes involved in translation and metabolism. Gene duplications were predominant in a cultivated wheat accession, while more gene deletions than duplications were identified in wild wheat. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that, even though the level of sequence similarity between targeted polyploid genomes and capture baits can bias enrichment efficiency, exon capture is a powerful approach for variant discovery in polyploids. Our results suggest that allopolyploid wheat can accumulate new variation in coding regions at a high rate. This process has the potential to broaden functional diversity and generate new phenotypic variation that eventually can play a critical role in the origin of new adaptations and important agronomic traits.},

  abstract = {Food security is an issue that has come under renewed scrutiny amidst concerns that substantial yield increases in cereal crops are required to feed the world’s booming population. Wheat is of fundamental importance in this regard being one of the three most important crops for both human consumption and livestock feed; however, increase in crop yields have not kept pace with the demands of a growing world population. In order to address this issue, plant breeders require new molecular tools to help them identify genes for important agronomic traits that can be introduced into elite varieties. Studies of the genome using next-generation sequencing enable the identification of molecular markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms that may be used by breeders to identify and follow genes when breeding new varieties. The development and application of next-generation sequencing technologies has made the characterisation of SNP markers in wheat relatively cheap and straightforward. There is a growing need for the widespread dissemination of this information to plant breeders.},

  abstract  = {Targeted Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING) is a reverse genetics approach to identify novel sequence variation in genomes, with the aims of investigating gene function and/or developing useful alleles for breeding. Despite recent advances in wheat genomics, most current TILLING methods are low to medium in throughput, being based on PCR amplification of the target genes. We performed a pilot-scale evaluation of TILLING in wheat by next-generation sequencing through exon capture. An oligonucleotide-based enrichment array covering ~2 Mbp of wheat coding sequence was used to carry out exon capture and sequencing on three mutagenised lines of wheat containing previously-identified mutations in the TaGA20ox1 homoeologous genes. After testing different mapping algorithms and settings, candidate SNPs were identified by mapping to the IWGSC wheat Chromosome Survey Sequences. Where sequence data for all three homoeologues were found in the reference, mutant calls were unambiguous; however, where the reference lacked one or two of the homoeologues, captured reads from these genes were mis-mapped to other homoeologues, resulting either in dilution of the variant allele frequency or assignment of mutations to the wrong homoeologue. Competitive PCR assays were used to validate the putative SNPs and estimate cut-off levels for SNP filtering. At least 464 high-confidence SNPs were detected across the three mutagenized lines, including the three known alleles in TaGA20ox1, indicating a mutation rate of ~35 SNPs per Mb, similar to that estimated by PCR-based TILLING. This demonstrates the feasibility of using exon capture for genome re-sequencing as a method of mutation detection in polyploid wheat, but accurate mutation calling will require an improved genomic reference with more comprehensive coverage of homoeologues.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: NAC transcription factors contain five highly conserved subdomains which are required for protein dimerisation and DNA binding. Few residues within these subdomains have been identified as essential for protein function, and fewer still have been shown to be of biological relevance in planta. Here we use a positive regulator of senescence in wheat, NAM-A1, to test the impact of missense mutations at specific, highly conserved residues of the NAC domain on protein function. RESULTS: We identified missense mutations in five highly conserved residues of the NAC domain of NAM-A1 in a tetraploid TILLING population. TILLING lines containing these mutations, alongside synonymous and non-conserved mutation controls, were grown under glasshouse conditions and scored for senescence. Four of the five mutations showed a significant and consistent delay in peduncle senescence but had no consistent effects on flag leaf senescence. All four mutant alleles with the delayed senescence phenotype also lost the ability to interact with the homoeolog NAM-B1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Two of these residues were previously shown to be involved in NAC domain function in Arabidopsis, suggesting conservation of residue function between species. Three of these four alleles led to an attenuated cell death response compared to wild-type NAM-A1 when transiently over-expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. One of these mutations was further tested under field conditions, in which there was a significant and consistent delay in both peduncle and leaf senescence. CONCLUSIONS: We combined field and glasshouse studies of a series of mutant alleles with biochemical analyses to identify four residues of the NAC domain which are required for NAM-A1 function and protein interaction. We show that mutations in these residues lead to a gradient of phenotypes, raising the possibility of developing allelic series of mutations for traits of agronomic importance. We also show that mutations in NAM-A1 more severely impact peduncle senescence, compared to the more commonly studied flag leaf senescence, highlighting this as an area deserving of further study. The results from this integrated approach provide strong evidence that conserved residues within the functional domains of NAC transcription factors have biological significance in planta.},

  abstract               = {Wheat and barley are two of the founder crops domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, and currently represent crops of major economic importance in temperate regions. Due to impacts on yield, quality and end-use, grain morphometric traits remain an important goal for modern breeding programmes and are believed to have been selected for by human populations. To directly and accurately assess the three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of grains, we combine X-ray microcomputed tomography (μCT) imaging techniques with bespoke image analysis tools and mathematical modelling to investigate how grain size and shape vary across wild and domesticated wheat and barley. We find that grain depth and, to a lesser extent, width are major drivers of shape change and that these traits are still relatively plastic in modern bread wheat varieties. Significant changes in grain depth are also observed to be associated with differences in ploidy. Finally, we present a model that can accurately predict the wild or domesticated status of a grain from a given taxa based on the relationship between three morphometric parameters (length, width and depth) and suggest its general applicability to both archaeological identification studies and breeding programmes.},

  abstract               = {Wheat plants growing under Mediterranean rain-fed conditions are exposed to water deficit, particularly during the grain filling period, and this can lead to a strong reduction in grain yield (GY). This study examines the effects of water deficit after during the grain filling period on photosynthetic and water-use efficiencies at the leaf and whole-plant level for 14 bread wheat genotypes grown in pots under glasshouse conditions. Two glasshouse experiments were conducted, one in a conventional glasshouse at the Universidad de Talca, Chile (Experiment 1), and another at the National Plant Phenomics Centre (NPPC), Aberystwyth, UK (Experiment 2), in 2015. Plants were grown under well-watered (WW) and water-limited (WL) conditions during grain filling. The reductions in leaf water potential (Ψ), net CO(2) assimilation (An) and stomatal conductance (gs) due to water deficit were 79, 35 and 55%, respectively, during grain filling but no significant differences were found among genotypes. However, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (as determined on dark-adapted and illuminated leaves) and chlorophyll content (Chl) were significantly different among genotypes, but not between water conditions. Under both water conditions, An presented a positive and linear relationship with the effective photochemical quantum yield of Photosystem II (Y(II)) and the maximum rate of electron transport (ETRmax), and negative with the quantum yield of non-photochemical energy conversion in Photosystem II (Y(NPQ)). The relationship between An and Chl was positive and linear for both water conditions, but under WL conditions An tended to be lower at any Chl value. Both, instantaneous (An/E) and intrinsic (An/gs) water-use efficiencies at the leaf level exhibited a positive and linear relationship with plant water-use efficiency (WUEp = plant dry weight/water use). Carbon discrimination (Δ(13)C) in kernels presented a negative relationship with WUEp, at both WW and WL conditions, and a positive relationship with GY. Our results indicate that during grain filling wheat plants face limitations to the assimilation process due to natural senesce and water stress. The reduction in An and gs after anthesis in both water conditions was mainly due a decline in the chlorophyll content (non-stomatal limitation), whereas the observed differences between water conditions were mainly due to a stomatal limitation.},

  abstract = {Future genetic progress in wheat grain yield will depend on increasing above-ground biomass and this must be achieved without commensurate increases in N fertilizer inputs to minimise environmental impacts. Our objective was to quantify variation in grain yield, above-ground biomass and N-use efficiency (NUE) and associated traits in a panel of diverse hexaploid wheat germplasm comprising: (i) landraces from the AE Watkins collection, (ii) synthetic-derived hexaploid lines in a cv. Paragon spring wheat background and (iii) UK modern cultivars including cv. Paragon under low N and high N conditions. A field experiment was carried out in two seasons examining 15 genotypes (five landraces, five synthetic-derived (SD) hexaploid lines and five UK modern cultivars) under low N and high N conditions at Nottingham University farm, UK. Machine-harvested grain yield, above-ground biomass and NUE were measured. Physiological traits were assessed including flag-leaf light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) and relative chlorophyll content (SPAD) under HN conditions; and flag-leaf senescence duration and rate and Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) under LN and HN conditions. Under HN conditions, the modern cultivars overall produced higher grain yield than the SD lines (+9.7%) and the landraces (+60.4%); and the modern cultivars and SD lines also produced higher biomass than the landraces (30.3% and 28.4%, respectively). Under LN conditions, reduction in grain yield and biomass compared to HN conditions was least for the landraces (−1% and −8.6%, respectively), intermediate for the SD lines (−7.4 and −10.2%, respectively) and highest for the modern cultivars (−9.3 and −24.6%, respectively). As a result, the SD lines had higher biomass (+17%) than the modern cultivars under LN conditions. Under HN conditions the synthetic derivatives (23.8μmolm−2s−1) and modern cultivars (241.1μmolm−2s−1) had higher pre-anthesis Amax than the landraces (19.7μmolm−2s−1) (P<0.001). Pre-anthesis Amax was strongly positively linearly associated with above-ground biomass (R2=0.63, P<0.001) and grain yield (R2=0.75, P<0.001) amongst the 15 genotypes. Flag-leaf Amax was also positively linearly associated with flag-leaf relative chlorophyll content at anthesis (R2=0.74; P<0.001). Comparing the SD lines to the recurrent parent Paragon, under HN conditions one line (SD 22) had higher pre-anthesis flag-leaf Amax than Paragon (P<0.05). Under LN conditions one line (SD 24, +27%) had higher yield than Paragon (P<0.05) and two lines (SD 24 and SD 38, +32% and +31%, respectively) had more biomass than Paragon (P<0.05). Our results indicated that introgressing traits from synthetic-derived wheat and landraces into UK modern wheat germplasm offers scope to raise above-ground biomass and grain yield in moderate-to-low N availability environments.},

In addition to this protective function, it has been shown that the photosynthetically active pod wall contributes assimilates and nutrients to fuel seed growth. Recent work has revealed that signals originating from the pod may also act to coordinate grain filling and regulate the reallocation of reserves from damaged seeds to those that have retained viability. In this review we consider the evidence that pods can regulate seed growth and maturation, particularly in members of the Brassicaceae family, and explore how the timing and duration of pod development might be manipulated to enhance either the quantity of crop yield or its nutritional properties.},

  abstract  = {Pasta and bread wheat are polyploid species that carry multiple copies of each gene. Therefore, loss-of-function mutations in one gene copy are frequently masked by functional copies on other genomes. We sequenced the protein coding regions of 2,735 mutant lines and developed a public database including more than 10 million mutations. Researchers and breeders can search this database online, identify mutations in the different copies of their target gene, and request seeds to study gene function or improve wheat varieties. Mutations are being used to improve the nutritional value of wheat, increase the size of the wheat grains, and generate additional variability in flowering genes to improve wheat adaptation to new and changing environments.Comprehensive reverse genetic resources, which have been key to understanding gene function in diploid model organisms, are missing in many polyploid crops. Young polyploid species such as wheat, which was domesticated less than 10,000 y ago, have high levels of sequence identity among subgenomes that mask the effects of recessive alleles. Such redundancy reduces the probability of selection of favorable mutations during natural or human selection, but also allows wheat to tolerate high densities of induced mutations. Here we exploited this property to sequence and catalog more than 10 million mutations in the protein-coding regions of 2,735 mutant lines of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. We detected, on average, 2,705 and 5,351 mutations per tetraploid and hexaploid line, respectively, which resulted in 35{\textendash}40 mutations per kb in each population. With these mutation densities, we identified an average of 23{\textendash}24 missense and truncation alleles per gene, with at least one truncation or deleterious missense mutation in more than 90\% of the captured wheat genes per population. This public collection of mutant seed stocks and sequence data enables rapid identification of mutations in the different copies of the wheat genes, which can be combined to uncover previously hidden variation. Polyploidy is a central phenomenon in plant evolution, and many crop species have undergone recent genome duplication events. Therefore, the general strategy and methods developed herein can benefit other polyploid crops.},

  abstract = {Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum) derives from a hybridization event approximately 400,000 years ago which led to the creation of an allotetraploid genome. The evolutionary recent origin of durum wheat means that its genome has not yet been fully diploidised. As a result, many of the genes present in the durum genome act in a redundant fashion, where loss-of-function mutations must be present in both gene copies to observe a phenotypic effect. Here, we use a novel set of induced variation within the cv. Kronos TILLING population to identify a locus controlling a dominant, environmentally dependent chlorosis phenotype. We carried out a forward screen of the sequenced cv. Kronos TILLING lines for senescence phenotypes and identified a line with a dominant early senescence and chlorosis phenotype. Mutant plants contained less chlorophyll throughout their development and displayed premature flag leaf senescence. A segregating population was classified into discrete phenotypic groups and subjected to bulked-segregant analysis using exome capture followed by next-generation sequencing. This allowed the identification of a single region on chromosome 3A, Yellow Early Senescence 1 (YES-1), which was associated with the mutant phenotype. While this phenotype was consistent across 4 years of field trials in the United Kingdom, the mutant phenotype was not observed when grown in Davis, CA (United States). To obtain further SNPs for fine-mapping, we isolated chromosome 3A using flow sorting and sequenced the entire chromosome. By mapping these reads against both the cv. Chinese Spring reference sequence and the cv. Kronos assembly, we could identify high-quality, novel EMS-induced SNPs in non-coding regions within YES-1 that were previously missed in the exome capture data. This allowed us to fine-map YES-1 to 4.3 Mb, containing 59 genes. Our study shows that populations containing induced variation can be sources of novel dominant variation in polyploid crop species, highlighting their importance in future genetic screens. We also demonstrate the value of using cultivar-specific genome assemblies alongside the gold-standard reference genomes particularly when working with non-coding regions of the genome. Further fine-mapping of the YES-1 locus will be pursued to identify the causal SNP underpinning this dominant, environmentally dependent phenotype.},

Despite their importance, a lack of genomic information and resources has hindered the functional characterisation of genes in major crops. The recent release of high-quality reference sequences for these crops underpins a suite of genetic and genomic resources that support basic research and breeding. For wheat, these include gene model annotations, expression atlases and gene networks that provide information about putative function. Sequenced mutant populations, improved transformation protocols and structured natural populations provide rapid methods to study gene function directly. We highlight a case study exemplifying how to integrate these resources. This review provides a helpful guide for plant scientists, especially those expanding into crop research, to capitalise on the discoveries made in \textit{Arabidopsis} and other plants. This will accelerate the improvement of crops of vital importance for food and nutrition security.},

  abstract           = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine the dynamics of gene expression. Interest often focuses on the topological structure of a GRN while numerical parameters (e.g. decay rates) are unknown and less important. For larger GRNs, inference of structure from gene expression data is prohibitively difficult. Models are often proposed based on integrative interpretation of multiple sources of information. We have developed DoGeNetS (Discrimination of Gene Network Structures), a method to directly assess candidate models of GRN structure against a target gene expression data set. The transsys language serves to model GRN structures. Numeric parameters are optimised to approximate the target data. Multiple restarts of optimisation yield score sets that provide a basis to statistically discriminate candidate models according to their potential to explain the target data. We demonstrate discrimination power of the DoGeNetS method by relating structural divergence to divergence between gene expression data sets. Known models are used to generate target expression data, and a set of candidate models with a defined structural divergence to the true model is produced. Structural divergence and divergence of expression profiles after optimisation are strongly correlated. We further show that discrimination is possible at noise levels exceeding those typical of contemporary microarray data. DoGeNetS is capable of discriminating the best GRN structure from among a small number of candidates. p values indicate whether differences in divergence of expression are significant. Although this study uses single gene knockouts, the DoGeNetS method can be adapted to simulate a virtually unlimited range of experimental conditions. [Includes supplementary material].},

Meeting the 1.5°C target requires rapid and ambitious changes to food systems as well as to all nonfood sectors.

  abstract = { Food systems contribute 19\%–29\% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, releasing 9,800–16,900 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2008. Agricultural production, including indirect emissions associated with land-cover change, contributes 80\%–86\% of total food system emissions, with significant regional variation. The impacts of global climate change on food systems are expected to be widespread, complex, geographically and temporally variable, and profoundly influenced by socioeconomic conditions. Historical statistical studies and integrated assessment models provide evidence that climate change will affect agricultural yields and earnings, food prices, reliability of delivery, food quality, and, notably, food safety. Low-income producers and consumers of food will be more vulnerable to climate change owing to their comparatively limited ability to invest in adaptive institutions and technologies under increasing climatic risks. Some synergies among food security, adaptation, and mitigation are feasible. But promising interventions, such as agricultural intensification or reductions in waste, will require careful management to distribute costs and benefits effectively. },

This paper builds on Garnett’s contribution by considering how high levels of food waste contribute to the food chain’s greenhouse emissions and how they can be reduced, something Garnett generally overlooks. The emissions that arise from food waste represent the emissions embedded in the production of food that is then wasted and the emissions that arise from the process of waste disposal. Food waste can also be split into pre-consumer and consumer waste. These distinctions give rise to four categories of food waste related emissions: pre-consumer embedded, pre-consumer waste disposal, consumer embedded and consumer waste disposal emissions. The levels of food waste in each category differ between economies, as do the causes of wastage. Policies to address food waste and the associated emissions need to promote a mixture of technological and behavioural change and be tailored to the economic, cultural and technological conditions in each country.},

  abstract  = {Food is produced and processed by millions of farmers and intermediaries globally, with substantial associated environmental costs. Given the heterogeneity of producers, what is the best way to reduce food{\textquoteright}s environmental impacts? Poore and Nemecek consolidated data on the multiple environmental impacts of \~{}38,000 farms producing 40 different agricultural goods around the world in a meta-analysis comparing various types of food production systems. The environmental cost of producing the same goods can be highly variable. However, this heterogeneity creates opportunities to target the small numbers of producers that have the most impact.Science, this issue p. 987Food{\textquoteright}s environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.},

Here we show that between 2010 and 2050, as a result of expected changes in population and income levels, the environmental effects of the food system could increase by 50-90% in the absence of technological changes and dedicated mitigation measures, reaching levels that are beyond the planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity. We analyse several options for reducing the environmental effects of the food system, including dietary changes towards healthier, more plant-based diets, improvements in technologies and management, and reductions in food loss and waste. We find that no single measure is enough to keep these effects within all planetary boundaries simultaneously, and that a synergistic combination of measures will be needed to sufficiently mitigate the projected increase in environmental pressures.},

  abstract = {Recent studies show that current trends in yield improvement will not be sufficient to meet projected global food demand in 2050, and suggest that a further expansion of agricultural area will be required. However, agriculture is the main driver of losses of biodiversity and a major contributor to climate change and pollution, and so further expansion is undesirable. The usual proposed alternative--intensification with increased resource use--also has negative effects. It is therefore imperative to find ways to achieve global food security without expanding crop or pastureland and without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Some authors have emphasized a role for sustainable intensification in closing global ‘yield gaps’ between the currently realized and potentially achievable yields. However, in this paper we use a transparent, data-driven model, to show that even if yield gaps are closed, the projected demand will drive further agricultural expansion. There are, however, options for reduction on the demand side that are rarely considered. In the second part of this paper we quantify the potential for demand-side mitigation options, and show that improved diets and decreases in food waste are essential to deliver emissions reductions, and to provide global food security in 2050.},

GIRFEC represents a unique case study of national transformative change within the contexts of children's well-being and universal services and is of relevance to other jurisdictions. Implementation is under way, with an understanding of well-being and the requirement for information sharing enshrined in law. Yet there is scope for interpretation within the legislation and associated guidance. Inherent tensions around intrusion, data gathering, professional roles, and balancing well-being against child protection threaten the effectiveness of the policy if not resolved. Context Despite persistent health inequalities and intergenerational deprivation, the Scottish government aspires for Scotland to be the best country for children to grow up in. Getting It Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) is a landmark children's policy framework to improve children's well-being via early intervention, universal service provision, and multiagency coordination across organizational boundaries. Placing the child and family “at the center,” this approach marks a shift from welfare to well-being, yet there is still a general lack of consensus over how well-being is defined and measured. As an umbrella policy framework with broad reach, GIRFEC represents the current and future direction of children's/family policy in Scotland, yet large-scale practice change is required for successful implementation. Methods This article explores the origins and emergence of GIRFEC and presents a critical analysis of its incremental design, development, and implementation. Findings There is considerable scope for interpretation within the GIRFEC legislation and guidance, most notably around assessment of well-being and the role and remit of those charged with implementation. Tensions have arisen around issues such as professional roles; intrusion, data sharing, and confidentiality; and the balance between supporting well-being and protecting children. Despite the policy's intentions for integration, the service landscape for children and families still remains relatively fragmented. Conclusions Although the policy has groundbreaking potential, inherent tensions must be resolved and the processes of change carefully managed in order for GIRFEC to be effective. It remains to be seen whether GIRFEC can fulfil the Scottish government's aspirations to reduce inequalities and improve lifelong outcomes for Scotland's children and young people. In terms of both a national children's well-being framework within a universal public service context and a distinct style of policymaking and implementation, the Scottish experience represents a unique case study of whole-country, transformational change and is of relevance to other jurisdictions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sustainable diets are proposed as a means to improve public health and food security and to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. Guidance around sustainable diets includes a reduction of animal products in order to move towards a more plant-based diet, meaning that plant-originated foods are a predominant, but not the sole component of a diet. The main principles of a sustainable diet (as provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization) are to consume a variety of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, mainly as wholegrains, pulses, fruits and vegetables, with moderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and fish and modest amounts of ruminant meat, which are consistent with the current UK healthy eating recommendations (e.g. Eatwell Guide). The aim of this review was twofold: (i) to discuss public health challenges associated with consumers’ knowledge regarding protein sustainability, healthier protein sources and protein requirements, and (ii) to review potential approaches to facilitate the shift towards a more sustainable diet. Consumers would benefit from receiving clear guidance around how much protein is needed to meet their daily requirements. The public health message directed to a consumer could highlight that desired health outcomes, such as muscle protein synthesis and weight control, can be achieved with both sources of protein (i.e. animal and plant-based), and that what is more important is the nature of the ‘protein package’. Health promotion and education around the benefits of plant-based protein could be one of the strategies encouraging the wider population to consider a shift towards a predominantly plant-based diet.},

  abstract  = {A growing global population, combined with factors such as changing socio-demographics, will place increased pressure on the world's resources to provide not only more but also different types of food. Increased demand for animal-based protein in particular is expected to have a negative environmental impact, generating greenhouse gas emissions, requiring more water and more land. Addressing this "perfect storm" will necessitate more sustainable production of existing sources of protein as well as alternative sources for direct human consumption. This paper outlines some potential demand scenarios and provides an overview of selected existing and novel protein sources in terms of their potential to sustainably deliver protein for the future, considering drivers and challenges relating to nutritional, environmental, and technological and market/consumer domains. It concludes that different factors influence the potential of existing and novel sources. Existing protein sources are primarily hindered by their negative environmental impacts with some concerns around health. However, they offer social and economic benefits, and have a high level of consumer acceptance. Furthermore, recent research emphasizes the role of livestock as part of the solution to greenhouse gas emissions, and indicates that animal-based protein has an important role as part of a sustainable diet and as a contributor to food security. Novel proteins require the development of new value chains, and attention to issues such as production costs, food safety, scalability and consumer acceptance. Furthermore, positive environmental impacts cannot be assumed with novel protein sources and care must be taken to ensure that comparisons between novel and existing protein sources are valid. Greater alignment of political forces, and the involvement of wider stakeholders in a governance role, as well as development/commercialization role, is required to address both sources of protein and ensure food security.},

  abstract = {Wheat is fundamental to human civilization and has played an outstanding role in feeding a hungry world and improving global food security. The crop contributes about 20 % of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 % annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 % of the total harvested area and 50 % of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 % of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR “spared” essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Cereal grains, such as wheat, barley, rice, rye, oat, millet, sorghum, and corn, have been staples in human diets since ancient times. At present, there is a significant body of scientific evidence showing the health benefits of consuming whole grains in chronic disease prevention, particularly in regards to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The objective was to determine bioactive peptides in cereal grains that may prevent cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes. Bioactive peptides that may be obtained from cereal grains, particularly wheat, oat, barley, and rice, were identified. Bioactive peptides that play a role in chronic disease prevention have been found primarily in legumes and dairy products; although research connecting cereal grains with potential bioactive peptide activity is limited. In this review, 4 cereal grains, wheat, oat, barley, and rice, were evaluated for bioactive peptide potential using the BIOPEP database. In addition, research information was compiled for each grain regarding evidence about the effect of their proteins in prevention of chronic diseases. All 4 grains showed high occurrence frequencies of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor peptides (A = 0.239 to 0.511), as well as of dipeptidyl peptidase-inhibitor and antithrombotic, antioxidant, hypotensive, and opioid activity. Wheat and rice proteins had anticancer sequences present. Wheat and barley showed the greatest diversity and abundance of potential biological activity among the cereal proteins. Further research needs to be conducted to learn how these biologically active peptide sequences are released from cereal grains. This study supports the notion that cereal grains are a nutritious part of a healthy diet by preventing chronic diseases.},

  abstract = {During the malting process, storage proteins are degraded by proteolytic enzymes into small peptides and amino acids. The activity of these enzymes was measured during malting of oats and was found to be increased. To quantify proteolytic degradation, proteins of unmalted, germinating and malted grains were fractionated. After extracting the oat proteins (Osborne fractionation), protein fractions were analysed using a Lab-on-a-Chip technique, which separates the proteins – based on their molecular weight – by capillary electrophoresis. This new technique for the analysis of proteins was supported by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In addition, amino acid analysis was carried out. In general a degradation of proteins to small peptides and amino acids could be observed in the globulin, prolamin and glutelin fractions. In the albumin fraction a protein increase was observed, which is due to the fact that this fraction contains the majority of the metabolically active proteins. Amino acid analysis supported the observation of increased protein amount in the albumin fraction and decreased protein amounts in the other fractions. Some proteins, which have not been described in the literature, were detected in the albumin and glutelin fraction, since Lab-on-a-Chip technique allows detection of proteins with low molecular weights of 4.5kDa.},

In a context of changing environments, crop models are useful tools to simulate crop yields. Wheat (Triticum spp.) crop models have been evolving since the 1960s to translate processes related to crop growth and development into mathematical equations. These have been used over decades for agronomic purposes, and have more recently incorporated advances in the modeling of environmental footprints, biotic constraints, trait and gene effects, climate change impact, and the upscaling of global change impacts. This review outlines the potential and limitations of modern wheat crop models in assisting agronomists, breeders, and policymakers to address the current and future challenges facing agriculture.},

However, with these current versions, it is difficult for users to adapt formulae, add functionality or incorporate the model into other applications such as decision support tools. Here, we report on the release of a version of AquaCrop written in R. Performance of the model was tested using published datasets of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.), comparing output from AquaCropR with these other versions of AquaCrop. Our goal in developing this version was to widen the use and improvement of AquaCrop through open access.},

  abstract  = {Gravity profoundly influences plant growth and development. Plants respond to changes in orientation by using gravitropic responses to modify their growth. Cholodny and Went hypothesized over 80 years ago that plants bend in response to a gravity stimulus by generating a lateral gradient of a growth regulator at an organ{\textquoteright}s apex, later found to be auxin. Auxin regulates root growth by targeting Aux/IAA repressor proteins for degradation. We used an Aux/IAA-based reporter, domain II (DII)-VENUS, in conjunction with a mathematical model to quantify auxin redistribution following a gravity stimulus. Our multidisciplinary approach revealed that auxin is rapidly redistributed to the lower side of the root within minutes of a 90{\textdegree} gravity stimulus. Unexpectedly, auxin asymmetry was rapidly lost as bending root tips reached an angle of 40{\textdegree} to the horizontal. We hypothesize roots use a {\textquotedblleft}tipping point{\textquotedblright} mechanism that operates to reverse the asymmetric auxin flow at the midpoint of root bending. These mechanistic insights illustrate the scientific value of developing quantitative reporters such as DII-VENUS in conjunction with parameterized mathematical models to provide high-resolution kinetics of hormone redistribution.},

Recently, however, systems biology and modeling have emerged as important approaches, as our understanding of root regulatory pathways has become more complex and interpreting pathway outputs has become less intuitive. To relate root genotype to phenotype, we must move beyond the examination of interactions at the genetic network scale and employ multiscale modeling approaches to predict emergent properties at the tissue, organ, organism, and rhizosphere scales. Understanding the underlying biological mechanisms and the complex interplay between systems at these different scales requires an integrative approach. Here, we describe examples of such approaches and discuss the merits of developing models to span multiple scales, from network to population levels, and to address dynamic interactions between plants and their environment.GlossaryGRNgene regulatory networkTFtranscription factormiRNAmicroRNAChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationARFauxin response transcription factorAux/IAAauxin/indole-3-acetic acidABAabscisic acidAPSIMAgricultural Production Systems SimulatorQTLquantitative trait locusRECORDRenovation and Coordination of Agroecosystem ModelingRNA-seqRNA analysis through complementary DNA sequencing at a massive scale},

  abstract  = {Plants respond to environmental change by triggering biochemical and developmental networks across multiple scales. Multiscale models that link genetic input to the whole-plant scale and beyond might therefore improve biological understanding and yield prediction. We report a modular approach to build such models, validated by a framework model of Arabidopsis thaliana comprising four existing mathematical models. Our model brings together gene dynamics, carbon partitioning, organ growth, shoot architecture, and development in response to environmental signals. It predicted the biomass of each leaf in independent data, demonstrated flexible control of photosynthesis across photoperiods, and predicted the pleiotropic phenotype of a developmentally misregulated transgenic line. Systems biology, crop science, and ecology might thus be linked productively in a community-based approach to modeling.Understanding how dynamic molecular networks affect whole-organism physiology, analogous to mapping genotype to phenotype, remains a key challenge in biology. Quantitative models that represent processes at multiple scales and link understanding from several research domains can help to tackle this problem. Such integrated models are more common in crop science and ecophysiology than in the research communities that elucidate molecular networks. Several laboratories have modeled particular aspects of growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, but it was unclear whether these existing models could productively be combined. We test this approach by constructing a multiscale model of Arabidopsis rosette growth. Four existing models were integrated with minimal parameter modification (leaf water content and one flowering parameter used measured data). The resulting framework model links genetic regulation and biochemical dynamics to events at the organ and whole-plant levels, helping to understand the combined effects of endogenous and environmental regulators on Arabidopsis growth. The framework model was validated and tested with metabolic, physiological, and biomass data from two laboratories, for five photoperiods, three accessions, and a transgenic line, highlighting the plasticity of plant growth strategies. The model was extended to include stochastic development. Model simulations gave insight into the developmental control of leaf production and provided a quantitative explanation for the pleiotropic developmental phenotype caused by overexpression of miR156, which was an open question. Modular, multiscale models, assembling knowledge from systems biology to ecophysiology, will help to understand and to engineer plant behavior from the genome to the field.},

  abstract = {Linking our understanding of biological processes at different scales is a major conceptual challenge in biology and aggravated by differences in research methods. Modelling can be a useful approach to consolidating our understanding across traditional research domains. The laboratory model species Arabidopsis is very widely used to study plant growth processes and has also been tested more recently in ecophysiology and population genetics. However, approaches from crop modelling that might link these domains are rarely applied to Arabidopsis. Here, we combine plant growth models with phenology models from ecophysiology, using the agent-based modelling language Chromar. We introduce a simpler Framework Model of vegetative growth for Arabidopsis, FM-lite. By extending this model to include inflorescence and fruit growth and seed dormancy, we present a whole-life-cycle, multi-model FM-life, which allows us to simulate at the population level in various genotype × environment scenarios. Environmental effects on plant growth distinguish between the simulated life history strategies that were compatible with previously described Arabidopsis phenology. Our results simulate reproductive success that is founded on the broad range of physiological processes familiar from crop models and suggest an approach to simulating evolution directly in future.},

  abstract = {Global population increase coupled with rising urbanization underlies the predicted need for 60% more food by 2050, but produced on the same amount of land as today. Improving photosynthetic efficiency is a largely untapped approach to addressing this problem. Here, we scale modelling processes from gene expression through photosynthetic metabolism to predict leaf physiology in evaluating acclimation of photosynthesis to rising atmospheric concentrations of CO2 ([CO2]). Model integration with the yggdrasil interface enabled asynchronous message passing between models. The multiscale model of soybean (Glycine max) photosynthesis calibrated to physiological measures at ambient [CO2] successfully predicted the acclimatory changes in the photosynthetic apparatus that were observed at 550 ppm [CO2] in the field. We hypothesized that genetic alteration is necessary to achieve optimal photosynthetic efficiency under global change. Flux control analysis in the metabolic system under elevated [CO2] identified enzymes requiring the greatest change to adapt optimally to the new conditions. This predicted that Rubisco was less limiting under elevated [CO2] and should be down-regulated allowing re-allocation of resource to enzymes controlling the rate of regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). By linking the Gene Regulatory Network through protein concentration to the metabolic model, it was possible to identify transcription factors (TFs) that matched the up- and down-regulation of genes needed to improve photosynthesis. Most striking was TF Gm-GATA2, which down-regulated genes for Rubisco synthesis while up-regulating key genes controlling RuBP regeneration and starch synthesis. The changes predicted for this TF most closely matched the physiological ideotype that the modelling predicted as optimal for the future elevated [CO2] world.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms behind lignin formation is an important research area with significant implications for the bioenergy and biomaterial industries. Computational models are indispensable tools for understanding this complex process. Models of the monolignol pathway in Populus trichocarpa and other plants have been developed to explore how transgenic modifications affect important bioenergy traits. Many of these models, however, only capture one level of biological organization and are unable to capture regulation across multiple biological scales. This limits their ability to predict how gene modification strategies will impact lignin and other wood properties. While the first multiscale model of lignin biosynthesis in P. trichocarpa spanned the transcript, protein, metabolic, and phenotypic layers, it did not account for cross-regulatory influences that could impact abundances of untargeted monolignol transcripts and proteins. Here, we present a multiscale model incorporating these cross-regulatory influences for predicting lignin and wood traits from transgenic knockdowns of the monolignol genes. The three main components of this multiscale model are (1) a transcript-protein model capturing cross-regulatory influences, (2) a kinetic-based metabolic model, and (3) random forest models relating the steady state metabolic fluxes to 25 physical traits. We demonstrate that including the cross-regulatory behavior results in smaller predictive error for 23 of the 25 traits. We use this multiscale model to explore the predicted impact of novel combinatorial knockdowns on key bioenergy traits, and identify the perturbation of PtrC3H3 and PtrCAld5H1&2 monolignol genes as a candidate strategy for increasing saccharification efficiencies while reducing negative impacts on wood density and height.},

  abstract = { The putative scale-free nature of real-world networks has generated a lot of interest in the past 20 years: if networks from many different fields share a common structure, then perhaps this suggests some underlying ‘network law’. Testing the degree distribution of networks for power-law tails has been a topic of considerable discussion. Ad hoc statistical methodology has been used both to discredit power-laws as well as to support them. This paper proposes a statistical testing procedure that considers the complex issues in testing degree distributions in networks that result from observing a finite network, having dependent degree sequences and suffering from insufficient power. We focus on testing whether the tail of the empirical degrees behaves like the tail of a de Solla Price model, a two-parameter power-law distribution. We modify the well-known Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to achieve even sensitivity along the tail, considering the dependence between the empirical degrees under the null distribution, while guaranteeing sufficient power of the test. We apply the method to many empirical degree distributions. Our results show that power-law network degree distributions are not rare, classifying almost 65\% of the tested networks as having a power-law tail with at least 80\% power. },

Despite the importance of senescence in plants, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. This study reports the isolation and functional analysis of RAV1, which encodes a RAV family transcription factor. Expression of RAV1 and its homologues is closely associated with leaf maturation and senescence. RAV1 mRNA increased at a later stage of leaf maturation and reached a maximal level early in senescence, but decreased again during late senescence. This profile indicates that RAV1 could play an important regulatory role in the early events of leaf senescence. Furthermore, constitutive and inducible overexpression of RAV1 caused premature leaf senescence. These data strongly suggest that RAV1 is sufficient to cause leaf senescence and it functions as a positive regulator in this process.},
