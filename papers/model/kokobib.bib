  abstract = {In spite of the economic importance and extensive agronomic literature on cocoa, no physiological production model has been developed for cocoa so far. Such a model would be very useful to compare yields in different climates and cropping systems, and to set the agenda for future agronomic research. Here, we present and apply such a physiological growth and production model for cocoa (SUCROS-Cocoa), based on the SUCROS-family of physiological crop growth models. Our model calculates light interception, photosynthesis, maintenance respiration, evapotranspiration, biomass production and bean yield for cocoa trees grown under shade trees. It can cope with both potential and water-limited situations, and is parameterised using existing information on cocoa physiology and morphology. A validation study showed that the model produces realistic output for bean yield, standing biomass, leaf area and size–age relations. Simulations were carried out using climatic information of 30 locations in 10 cocoa-producing countries, three different soil types and varying shade levels. The model was applied to answer four questions that are currently relevant to cocoa production. (1) Which are the most important yield-determining parameters? Sensitivity analyses revealed that these parameters were chiefly related to the morphology of fruits, photosynthesis and maintenance respiration. (2) To what extent can cocoa yield be predicted by rainfall and irradiance data? Regression analyses showed that over 70% of the variation in simulated bean yield could be explained by a combination of annual radiation and rainfall during the two driest months. (3) How large is the cocoa yield gap due to water limitation? Yield gaps were large – up to 50% – for locations with a strong dry season combined with an unfavourable (clayey or sandy) soil. The calculated yield gaps decreased exponentially with the amount of rain during the two driest months. (4) What are the consequences of shading on cocoa yield? Our simulations showed that moderate shade levels hardly affected bean yield, whereas heavy shading (>60%) reduced yields by more than one-third.},

  abstract = {The detailed description of growth stages of useful plants followed by adequate codification facilitates communication between scientists and practicians if, for example, new findings of science have to be transferred to management procedures or if experiences made at one growing site have to be adapted to another. We describe the growth stages of the worldwide species of cacao trees (Theobroma sp.) to prepare the basis for production management, comparisons of epidemiological studies of disease, of growth patterns under different environmental factors and of genetically clone specific parameters. The codification follows the ‘extended BBCH (BBCH, Biologische Bundesantalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemische Industrie, Germany) scale’, a numerical system that differentiates between principal, secondary and tertiary growth stages. Each growth stage presented from seed germination to crown development and harvest is correlated with general management practices. This scale will be of great help to cacao growers and scientists around the world for better communication, more efficient planning of management practices and experiments.},

  abstract       = {Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., is a plant fibre of significant economic importance, with seeds providing an additional source of protein in human and animal nutrition. Flavonoids play a vital role in maintaining plant health and function and much research has investigated the role of flavonoids in plant defence and plant vigour and the influence these have on cotton production. As part of ongoing research into host plant/invertebrate pest interactions, we investigated the flavonoid profile of cotton reported in published, peer-reviewed literature. Here we report 52 flavonoids representing seven classes and their reported distribution within the cotton plant. We briefly discuss the historical research of flavonoids in cotton production and propose research areas that warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {Crop models are important tools for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production. While multiple models have been developed over the past decades for the major food and fiber crops such as wheat, maize, soybean, rice, and cotton, there are few or none for many other crops. The goal of this study was to develop a simple generic crop model (SIMPLE) that could be easily modified for any crop to simulate development, crop growth and yield. The crop model SIMPLE includes 13 parameters to specify a crop type, with four of these for cultivar characteristics. Commonly available inputs that are required for the crop model SIMPLE include daily weather data, crop management, and soil water holding parameters. The initial SIMPLE model was calibrated and evaluated for 14 different annual crops using observations for biomass growth, solar radiation interception, and yield from 25 detailed field experiments for a total of 70 treatments from 17 sites, resulting in a RRMSE of 25.4% for final yield. A sensitivity analysis comparing a C3, C4 and a legume crop showed an expected response to a gradual increase in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A regional gridded simulation for US potatoes reproduced the general observed patterns of spatial yield variability. Because the model is simple, it has several limitations, including the lack of response to vernalization and photoperiod effect on phenology. The model includes water, but no nutrient dynamics. However, an advantage of the model simplicity is that it can be easily adapted and evaluated for any new crop, based on literature data and field experiments, or general crop data such as sowing and harvest dates and yield statistics. The model is available in several simulation frameworks including a stand-alone version in R, Excel and as part of DSSAT.},
